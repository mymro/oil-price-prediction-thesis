Ray Attrill, head of foreign exchange strategy at National Australia Bank said in a note that this month's sell-off in stocks could have been due to "a simple rush to book some profits." "The smaller-cap Russell 2000, representing companies that should not be particularly sensitive to either US bond yields or trade concerns, started falling well ahead of the US household name indices, and month-to-date is now off almost 10%," Attrill said.
