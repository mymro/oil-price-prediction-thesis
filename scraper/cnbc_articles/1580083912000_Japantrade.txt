"Uncertainty continues to weigh on markets with increasing concerns about the deadly and contagious coronavirus, which continues to spread," Liz Kendall, senior economist at ANZ Research, wrote in a morning note. More than 2,700 people in China have been infected by the deadly pneumonia-like virus that comes from a large family of viruses known as coronaviruses. Chinese authorities said 461 people are in critical condition while 80 people have died so far from the disease. The scale of the virus outbreak is already affecting the Chinese economy, according to preliminary data. Internationally, more cases have also been reported in countries like the United States, Singapore, Australia, and South Korea.
