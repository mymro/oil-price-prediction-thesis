"My view to investors basically is to say: 'You have no edge, you have no understanding, you really don't know what's going to happen. You can try to trade it but really you're trading blind,'" Viktor Shvets, head of Asian strategy at Macquarie Commodities and Global Markets, told CNBC's "Capital Connection" on Tuesday. China announced Monday that it will raise tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, beginning on June 1. The goods targeted include a broad range of agricultural products. Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump raised duties on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. At a White House event Monday evening, Trump gave an estimate of when a breakthrough in negotiations with China could be announced. "We'll let you know in three or four weeks if it's successful," he said, according to NBC News. Prior to the recent escalation in tensions, markets had largely anticipated the two economic powerhouses to be close to reaching a deal that would end their protracted trade fight. "We believe the talks broke down due largely to what we perceive as irreconcilable differences between US security concerns about China's industrial policy and China's dedication to these policies as means to avoid the 'middle income trap'," analysts at Barclays wrote in a note. "In our new baseline scenario, we assume that the US places tariffs on most, if not all, imports from China over time and China responds with measures of its own, though not in proportion. We estimate direct net economic losses to the US at 0.2-0.3% of GDP over the long run," the analysts said, adding, "Indirect effects from a loss in business or consumer confidence, or from an escalation in financial market volatility, could easily lead to larger declines in output and employment." Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC the two countries are "still in negotiations." Trump also said the U.S. is in a "great position," noting that "our economy has been very powerful; theirs has not been." Tuesday's session in Asia followed overnight declines on Wall Street.
