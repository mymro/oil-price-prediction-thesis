"All that supports the Bank of Japan ... staying on hold for the foreseeable future," he said.Elsewhere, mainland Chinese stocks recovered from an earlier slip by the market close.

"If the unemployment rate levels out that's fine, but it's actually got to be falling, we've gotta get a pick up in wages growth and that's all got to flow through for the RBA to get inflation back to target so I wouldn't dismiss the idea that the RBA might still have to do a bit more easing yet."Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index was 0.36% lower.Shares on Wall Street declined overnight, ending their five day winning streak.
