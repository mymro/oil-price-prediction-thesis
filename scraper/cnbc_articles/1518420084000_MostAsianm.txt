Heavy declines were seen in Asian markets last week: Japan's closed lower by 2.32 percent in the previous session and was down 11.38 percent from its 52-week high as of Friday. Greater China markets were some of the worst performers last week, with Hong Kong's 11.88 percent below its 52-week high as of Friday. Those losses mirrored declines seen stateside on investor concerns over rising interest rates. The global rout in stock markets began earlier this month when the Dow lost 666 points after a stronger-than-expected jobs report saw U.S. bond yields rise. Markets stateside closed higher in the last session although last week was their worst in two years. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 330.44 points, or 1.38 percent, to finish the day at 24,190.90. Despite those gains, the Dow still finished the week lower by 5.2 percent. "The severity of the falls globally ... suggest we may have already seen the worst, but with bond yields likely to go back up further and uncertainty about how much the unwinding of short volatility positions has to go, further weakness cannot be ruled out in the short term," Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at chief economist of AMP Capital, said in a Friday note. Still, in the absence of a recession, "the pullback is just another correction," Oliver added. Rob Carnell, chief economist and Asia Pacific head of research at ING, said in a Monday note that what was happening in stock and bond markets "will be delivering pain to some," but would not be a meltdown. Meanwhile, U.S. stock index futures implied a positive open ahead of the U.S. market open on Monday. On the commodities front, oil prices rebounded after sinking on Friday for a sixth straight day. Those declines came on the back of rising production and the firmer dollar last week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate gained 1.18 percent to trade at $59.90 per barrel after falling below the $59 level on Friday for the first time this year. Brent crude futures edged higher by 1 percent to trade at $63.42. In currencies, the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of rivals, edged down to trade at 90.151, below last Friday's close of 90.346. Against the yen, the dollar was softer at 108.65 at 2:58 p.m. HK/SIN. The Australian dollar was a touch firmer at $0.7828.
