The Fed's Powell said Wednesday that recently low inflation pressures may just be "transitory," hinting that a rate cut may not be on the horizon, which disappointed traders.

Ahead of the meeting, U.S. President Donald Trump had asked the central bank to cut rates and increase stimulus. Meanwhile, investors also have an eye on the U.S. jobs data for April, with nonfarm payrolls set to be released later on Friday stateside. "Payrolls tonight are expected (to) reveal still robust levels of payrolls growth (190K) but there'll be more than one eye on what the report says about average earnings growth that's expected to grow a meagre 0.1%," David de Garis, a director and senior economist at National Australia Bank, wrote in a morning note. Another economist said the wage numbers are "critically important." "Any kind of upward spike" in the wage numbers is likely to "upset" the markets, Rob Carnell, chief economist and head of Asia Pacific research at ING, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday. If "substantial wage growth" is observed, the possibility of rate cuts by the Fed would be taken "right off the table," Carnell said.
