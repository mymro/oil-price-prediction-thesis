They said White House officials are looking at a longer-term timeline."Markets have been waiting for so long for (a) face-to-face meeting and it looks like it's going to happen now next week," Rob Subbaraman, head of global macro research at Nomura, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Wednesday."I think it's still really early days," Subbaraman said. "There's still a long way to go in terms of ... the so-called U.S. wanting China to change its structural policies."Furthermore, he added, the issues between the two economic powerhouses and Taiwan are "relevant" to the discussion. China's defense ministry said Wednesday that issues regarding Taiwan are becoming more acute, Reuters reported. China had earlier asked the U.S. State Department to cancel a potential $2.2 billion arms sales to Taiwan.Subbaraman said the timing of the Wednesday's announcement from China was "interesting" and that there was a "reasonable chance" it was linked to the upcoming U.S.-China trade negotiations.The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 97.675 rising from levels below 97.5 yesterday.The Japanese yen, widely viewed as a safe-haven currency, traded at 108.08 after touching an earlier low of 108.27.
