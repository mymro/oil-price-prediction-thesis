U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that American trade officials received overnight calls from the Chinese saying Beijing was ready to return to the negotiating table.On the part of the Chinese, however, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he was unaware that a phone call between the two parties had occurred. That was further backed by Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief at Chinese state-run newspaper The Global Times, who said in a tweet Monday: "Based on what I know, Chinese and US top negotiators didn't hold phone talks in recent days."Those developments came following a recent intensification in tensions, with both China and the U.S. announcing that new tariffs will be slapped on billions of dollars worth of each others goods."President Trump's continued escalation of tensions gives little room for China (or indeed the US) to compromise without losing face, which makes a deal less likely in the near term," Tapas Strickland, an economist at National Australia Bank, wrote in a morning note.It's "clear" that Trump and his administration still want to get a deal with China, if it "meaningfully addresses some of the concerns" raised surrounding issues such as forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft, Clete Williams, partner at Akin Group, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Tuesday."That said, I do think you're seeing the president say one thing on Friday, something else today," Williams said. "A lot of folks are trying to understand that, my advice to them is stay calm, don't read into every single comment. If you can't stay calm, bet on volatility because you're gonna see a lot of ups and downs and back and forth between now and when a deal ... is reached."The Chinese yuan was closely watched on Tuesday, after offshore trading of the currency touched a record low on Monday amid the trade turmoil.
