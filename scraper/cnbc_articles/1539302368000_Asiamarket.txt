Commenting on the plunge in stocks stateside, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday from the Oval Office: "It's a correction that I think is caused by the Fed and interest rates." Trump said he believes the U.S. central bank's monetary policy "is far too stringent," adding that "they're making a mistake and it's not right," and saying he was "not going to fire" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Echoing Trump's sentiment on the Fed's interest rate policy, Richard Bove, chief market strategist at Rafferty Capital Markets, told CNBC on Friday: "The Federal Reserve cannot, you know, set interest rates at such a high level when every other major central bank in the world does not follow." "It creates currency problems, inflation problems, interest rate problems and maybe recession problems in other countries and therefore, the flow of funds that was coming to the United States stops and I think that's what's happening right now," Bove said. White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow also told CNBC on Thursday "there's some movement" toward a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Argentina at the G-20 summit in November, though the talks and topics to be addressed by the two leaders have not "been set in concrete."
