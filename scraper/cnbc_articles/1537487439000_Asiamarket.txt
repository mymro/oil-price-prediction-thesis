Asia markets were largely positive on the final trading day of the week, following record highs on Wall Street. Japan's Nikkei 225 pared some of its earlier gains but still ended the trading week higher by 0.82 percent at 23,869.93, with the insurance sector rising by 2.17 percent.

The moves in Japan followed a data release which showed that its nationwide core consumer price index for August rose 0.9 percent compared to a year ago. It was in line with expectations from a Reuters poll but still off the Bank of Japan's inflation target of 2 percent. "It will be difficult for the Japan inflation (rate) to reach 2 percent before the consumption tax rate is raised," Takuji Okubo, chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors, told CNBC, in reference to the Japanese government's plan to raise the consumption tax rate from 8 to 10 percent in 2019.
