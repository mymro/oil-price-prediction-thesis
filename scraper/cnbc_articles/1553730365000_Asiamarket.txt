Investors are keeping an eye on rates after the 10-year fell below the 3-month rate last week for the first time since 2007. It is a development that investors call an inverted yield curve and is seen as an early indicator of a recession. "The reason why it is so accurate is because when short term rates exceed long time rates, it is telling us that investors are worried about the near term outlook for the economy and want to be compensated more for tying up their money during this time," Kathy Lien, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, wrote in an overnight note. "Investors are having a hard time deciding whether the drop in yields is positive or negative for stocks," Lien said. "On the one hand, lower rates are good for borrowing but on the other, the yield curve inverted as a result of falling interest rates." On the U.S.-China trade front, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set to engage in trade negotiations Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday night in Beijing, according to China's commerce ministry. Ahead of the meeting, Reuters reported that the Chinese side made unprecedented proposals on issues such as forced technology transfer, citing U.S. officials. "I think this time around ... the context is different," Chou Chong, head of Asia equity at Ostrum Asset Management Asia, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Thursday. "The bag of tricks or what you call the easy hanging fruits that China had — global trade, people buying more goods — that's kind of running out a bit." The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 96.855 after seeing an earlier high of 96.976.
