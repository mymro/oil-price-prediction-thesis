U.S. data released Wednesday showed the country's trade deficit soaring to a 10-year high of $59.8 billion in December, climbing despite President Donald Trump's efforts to reduce the figure. Economists surveyed by Reuters had been looking for an increase to $57.3 billion, from November's $50.3 billion, which was revised up $1 billion in the latest count. One analyst told CNBC that U.S. President Donald Trump could make a deal with China, if the latter agrees to make more purchases from the U.S. "I think that one thing we've learned from Washington D.C. is that this president is very transactional," David Riedel, president and founder of Riedel Research Group, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Thursday. "I think if he does see a deal on the table that involves considerable purchases by China ... of goods and commodities and things from the United States, he may just take it," Riedel said. Officials from Washington and Beijing have been engaging in negotiations in an attempt to strike a deal on trade following a tariff fight that began in 2018. Meanwhile, tensions between both countries escalated, with Huawei suing the U.S. earlier on Thursday, claiming that the law which bans it from selling equipment to government agencies is unconstitutional.
