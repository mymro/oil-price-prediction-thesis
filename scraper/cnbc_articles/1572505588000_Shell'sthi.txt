That compared with a profit of $5.624 billion in the same quarter a year ago and $3.462 billion in the second quarter.Analysts had expected third-quarter net income attributable to shareholders on a CCS basis, and excluding identified items, to come in at $6.468 billion, according to data from Refinitiv.Separately, a company-provided analyst consensus had estimated a profit forecast of $3.912 billion.Shares of Shell dipped almost 2% shortly after the opening bell.Here are the key highlights:"This quarter we continued to deliver strong cash flow and earnings, despite sustained lower oil and gas prices, and chemicals margins," Ben van Beurden, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, said in a statement.Shell also announced it had launched the next tranche of its share buyback program, with a maximum aggregate consideration of $2.75 billion in the period up to and including Jan. 27, 2020. The oil giant said it had bought back $12 billion in shares for cancellation."Our intention to buy back $25 billion in shares and reduce net debt remains unchanged.
