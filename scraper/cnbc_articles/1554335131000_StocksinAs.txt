Several points," Kudlow told reporters at an event hosted by The Christian Science Monitor. Previously, he said, "they were in denial.""A lot of the news around the trade negotiations, I think ... is priced in to the markets. I think markets are expecting a pretty comprehensive deal to come through, timing still uncertain," Rob Subbaraman, head of emerging markets economics at Nomura, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Thursday."To really give the markets another lift, we need to see some of the existing tariffs, whether it's on the $50 billion or the $200 billion, actually rolled back," Subbaraman said."News that a US-China trade agreement is virtually a done deal has fuelled optimism," Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, wrote in a morning note. "But markets may be converging too quickly on the 'done' before the 'deal.'"Varathan said there remained "landmines" in the implementation and enforcement of any deal that might emerge, citing examples such as Washington's demands that Beijing "gives up its right of retaliation" if the U.S. "unilaterally but proportionally imposes tariffs on China's non-compliance.""A deal that needs to be done is not quite the same as a done deal," he said.The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 97.099 after seeing levels above 97.2 yesterday.The Japanese yen traded at 111.37 against the dollar after seeing an earlier low of 111.51.
