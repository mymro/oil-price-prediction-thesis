On the U.S.-China trade front, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that China agreed to open its cloud-computing sector to foreign companies in an attempt to sweeten a deal with the U.S. That report followed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin telling CNBC on Wednesday that Washington and Beijing have "pretty much agreed on an enforcement mechanism" for when a deal is struck.The two economic powerhouses have been attempting to strike a deal amid a protracted trade fight. "We are hopeful we can do this quickly, but we are not going to set an arbitrary deadline," Mnuchin added. "If we can complete this agreement, this will be the most significant changes to the economic relationship between the U.S. and China in really the last 40 years." Meanwhile, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida told CNBC on Thursday that officials at the central bank see no necessity to move interest rates in either direction at present. "One of the virtues of having the ability to be patient is that you just let the data come in," he told CNBC on Thursday. "We don't see a need now for a move in either direction." Clarida's comments came a day after the FOMC released minutes from its March meeting, at which the Fed adjusted its forecast to no rate moves this year. The minutes reflected a central bank that will watch the data closely this year, with some members leaving open the chance of a rate hike if conditions continue to improve. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 97.027 after touching a high of 97.178 earlier.
