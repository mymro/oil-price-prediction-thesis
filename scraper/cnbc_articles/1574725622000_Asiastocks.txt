Markets have been watching for developments and details surrounding an anticipated "phase one" trade deal that has so far remained elusive ahead of Dec. 15, when additional tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. are set to go into effect. "I think we need a phase one deal very soon because Dec. 15 probably will be the deadline for doing so," Alex Wong, director of asset management at Ample Capital, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Tuesday. "I think that this one is very needed because the market actually is very (optimistic) ... on getting a phase one deal soon."
