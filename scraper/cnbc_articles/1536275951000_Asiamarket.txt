ANZ Research Chief Economist (Greater China) Raymond Yeung said in a report on Friday that "an end point" has not been reached in the U.S.-China trade conflict. "We believe the US government will continue to escalate the scale and scope of trade and investment measures against China ... The Trump administration is not simply targeting the bilateral trade balance between the US and China. If it is, the trade friction would have been eased back in May," he wrote. "The administration's policy towards China is also targeting other aspects such as technology transfer, and the ultimate objective is to ensure that the US remains the largest economy in the world," he said, adding that this policy direction is unlikely to change even after the U.S. midterm elections in November. Meanwhile, negotiations between the U.S. and Canada are still underway as the two parties seek to come to an agreement on the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The talks are expected to continue and could potentially last weeks.
