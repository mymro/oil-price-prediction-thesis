Overnight on Wall Street, stocks stateside touched their lows in the Wednesday session as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer hinted that a trade deal was not yet certain, saying that any agreement would need to be more than just purchases by China. "It's not clear yet that (Trump's) got a win on that China trade deal," Richard Martin, managing director at IMA Asia, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Thursday, adding that the U.S. president was the "only one actually who's saying he's got a win" in his tweets. "We've yet to see what the Chinese are gonna say and no one has a clue what are in the documents that are being put together," Martin said. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China eased this week after Trump pushed back a closely-watched deadline on adding additional tariffs on Chinese goods. On the geopolitical front, investors are watching for developments in the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan, after both sides carried out airstrikes against each other. "India-Pakistan relationships took a precarious turn yesterday over border skirmishes involving both countries' army and air forces. Questions arise over whether such instances can leave lasting impact on markets," said DBS Group Research in a note. "Developments are fluid and uncertain at this junction." Past instances, however, have showed that the majority of such tensions between the two countries had a "short-lived and localised" impact, they said. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 96.136 after touching lows below 95.9 yesterday. The Japanese yen, often viewed as a safe-haven currency, traded at 110.78 against the dollar after seeing an earlier low of 111.00. The Australian dollar changed hands at $0.7129 after touching an earlier high of $0.7166. Oil prices traded lower in the afternoon of Asian trading hours. The international benchmark Brent crude futures contract slipped 0.59 percent to $66.00 per barrel.
