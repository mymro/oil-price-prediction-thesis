U.S. government debt prices retreated on Friday as investors grew more optimistic about a U.S.-China trade agreement. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, rose to around 1.8333%, the first day of gains since Monday. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also higher at around 2.3097%. Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, said Thursday that Washington is getting close to a trade deal with Beijing. His comments have followed recent reports that both countries had hit an impasse over agricultural products and intellectual property rights. Retail sales increased 0.3% last month, lifted by motor vehicle purchases and higher gasoline prices, the Commerce Department said on Friday. However, the data also showed big-ticket purchases dropped last month. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that he does not see signs of bubbles brewing amid concerns over higher corporate and government debt. There are no Treasury auctions scheduled.
