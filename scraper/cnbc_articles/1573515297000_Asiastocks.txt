U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday he had not agreed to roll back tariffs on China. That conflicted with comments from the Chinese commerce ministry, which said both sides had agreed to cancel existing levies in phases. A U.S. official also said both sides agreed to roll back the tariffs in tranches.“Markets are reacting to every gyration in these sort of tweets and trade comments,” Mitul Kotecha, senior emerging markets strategist at TD Securities, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Tuesday.“The reality is, of course, that both sides do want a deal. It does seem like we’re heading towards at least a phase one deal and it’s sometime in December,” Kotecha said. “The question is, though, what really happens to tariffs in that phase one deal?”“The markets might be a little bit extended in terms of pricing in a very positive trajectory on an end to this whole tariff tension,” Sameer Goel, head of Asia macro strategy at Deutsche Bank, told CNBC’s “Capital Connection” on Tuesday.“It is possible that we may be … past the peak in tariffs but it’s also true that the market seems to have overpriced their expectations, not just about a ceasefire ... on trade tensions but about a potential rollback,” Goel said.Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a record close, adding 10.25 points to 27,691.49.
