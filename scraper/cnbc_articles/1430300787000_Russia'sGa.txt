Russia's top natural gas producer Gazprom said on Wednesday its net income declined by 86 percent last year to 159 billion roubles ($3.1 billion) due to a weaker Russian currency and increased impairment charges. Russia's oil and gas producers have suffered from weaker oil prices while a drop in the rouble has inflated their dollar-denominated debts. Gazprom has also cut sales of gas to Ukraine which used to be one of its key markets, due to a debt and pricing dispute. The company said it sustained foreign exchange losses of 1.1 trillion roubles ($21.2 billion) last year, while charges for impairment and other provisions rose by 245.5 billion roubles, including for provisions related to its spat with Ukraine. Total sales increased to 5.59 trillion roubles from 5.25 trillion roubles in 2013, Gazprom said in a statement.
