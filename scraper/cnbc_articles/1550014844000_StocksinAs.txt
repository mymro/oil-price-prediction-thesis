Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, along with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, are in Beijing this week for another round of negotiations with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.A morning note from strategists at DBS Group Research sounded a warning “not to count the chickens before they hatch.”“The pendulum on whether a US-China trade deal could be struck has been swinging with US President Donald Trump’s comments on his on/off meeting with China President Xi Jinping to extending talks beyond the 1st of March. The extension will only be possible if China accedes to US’s push for enforcement mechanisms on areas such as forced technology transfer and intellectual property protection,” they said.“I’m expecting what I’ve said all along,” Andrew Collier, managing director at Orient Capital Research, told CNBC’s “Street Signs” on Wednesday.Collier said the two countries will likely agree on more market access, increased purchase of goods, and what is being termed a ” snap back.” This means that if there is no improvement in intellectual property protection and state subsidies, the tariffs will be reimposed, he said.“The snap back would probably be over a six to 12 month period and the question is ... how long is that period and what kind of snap back tariffs will they put in place?” Collier said. “That’s what they’re fighting over now, I believe.”The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 96.676 after seeing a high around 97.2 yesterday.The Japanese yen traded at 110.63 against the dollar after seeing an earlier high of 110.41.
