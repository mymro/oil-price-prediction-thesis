Other predictions include oil finishing the year as one of the three best-performing sectors, as well as China's GDP growth rate hitting a three-decade low and the technology sector underperforming.A "surprise" on the list, which has been published for nearly 30 years and includes five positive and five negative outcomes, is defined as an event outside the firm's core scenario, but one where the distribution skews.
