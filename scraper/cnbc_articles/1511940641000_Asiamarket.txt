Asian markets closed mostly higher on Wednesday as investors mostly shrugged off North Korea's latest missile launch. North Korea on Wednesday local time launched a likely intercontinental ballistic missile that landed in the Sea of Japan, according to the Pentagon. The launch, the North's first since Sept. 15, came after the U.S. classified North Korea as a country that supported terrorism on Nov. 20. Following the launch, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would "take care of" the situation. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump have also agreed to increase their cooperation on the North, Reuters said, citing Japanese media. North Korea later boasted through local media that its new ICBM was capable of reaching the U.S., but the rogue nation claimed its weapons program would not threaten countries that did not infringe on the North's sovereignty. Despite that, most markets in Asia edged higher, following the strong lead from U.S. stocks on tax reform progress and after Federal Reserve Chair nominee Jerome Powell's Senate testimony.
