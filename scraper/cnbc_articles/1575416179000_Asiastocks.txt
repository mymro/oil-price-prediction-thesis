When asked if he had a deadline for the deal, he added: "I have no deadline, no.""Hopefully it's just negotiating tactics and posturing in the run up to the December 15th deadline and we'll see some sort of resolution well ahead of ... the 12 month timeline," James Thom, investment director of Asian equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Wednesday.Even if tariffs do increase come Dec. 15, Thom said: "Who knows how long that will last, there's always the scope to roll that back."Principal Global Investors' Seema Shah dubbed Trump's latest comments as a "ploy to regain the upper hand in these negotiations.""Just like muscle memory, markets need to learn from experience that there is little to gain from reacting too sharply to Trump's trade related comments in the run-up to a deal," Shah, who is chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said in a note. "In the past 18 months he has clearly demonstrated that this 'to and fro' is his preferred form of negotiation."Fox News reported that the White House still plans on moving ahead with scheduled Dec. 15 tariffs on Chinese goods notwithstanding recent efforts at a "phase one" trade truce.Overnight stateside, stocks tumbled amid the trade uncertainty.
