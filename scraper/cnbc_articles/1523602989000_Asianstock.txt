The overall improvement in investor confidence came after President Donald Trump's Thursday tweet on Syria, as well as a de-escalation in recent trade tensions. "Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!" Trump said in a tweet on Thursday. A Twitter post from the president on Wednesday taunting Russia on Syria saw stock markets decline earlier this week amid concerns over heightened geopolitical tensions. "Market sentiment remains at the mercy of political rhetoric and ... the theme from the overnight session is that there are encouraging signs of an ease in tensions in Syria along with improved prospects for resolutions in trade tensions," Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank, said in a note. Of note, Trump asked his advisors to consider rejoining a major Trans-Pacific trade deal after first pulling out of the agreement last year. Following the U.S. withdrawal, the remaining 11 countries have since signed the trade agreement earlier this year. He later said in another tweet that he would only re-enter the agreement if it was "substantially better" than what was offered to former U.S. president Barack Obama.

Newly imposed and proposed tariffs from both countries had caused jitters in global stock markets in recent weeks. Earnings season also kicked off stateside, with Citigroup and J.P.
