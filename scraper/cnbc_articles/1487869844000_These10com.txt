You can find plenty of employers that offer retirement plans with generous matching contributions and low-cost investing options. But if you want access to the 10 best 401(k) plans, it helps to be an airline pilot, a quarterback, a roughneck or a chemist.

Retirement plan sponsors continue to shift assets from actively managed mutual funds to lower-cost index funds that track market benchmarks. Index funds represented nearly 41 percent of assets help in the 30 top 401(k) plans, a 6 percent rise since BrightScope's last analysis. More than 10 percent of the assets held in BrightScope's top 30 401(k) plans are invested in target-date funds, which are pre-mixed portfolios that automatically invest more conservatively over time. Don't fret if you're not lucky enough to work for a company with a highly rated 401(k) plan. "These 401(k) rankings are the tip of the iceberg," said Trisha Brambley, CEO of Retirement Playbook, a retirement plan advisor search firm. Most retirement plan sponsors will continue to focus on lowering costs for participants, Brambley said. "Every little bit helps increase retirement savings," she said.
