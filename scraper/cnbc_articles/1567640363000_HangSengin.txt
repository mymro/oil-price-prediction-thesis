Hong Kong stocks largely clung on to gains Thursday after seeing a 4% surge a day earlier, on the back of news that the city's controversial extradition bill that's sparked protests will be withdrawn. The Hang Seng index closed just below the flatline at 26,515.53, after strong gains on Wednesday. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Wednesday fully withdrew a controversial extradition bill in Hong Kong that had sparked protests for months. It was one of five demands that protesters have been fighting for. One investor described Wednesday's surge as a "technical rebound." "I strongly think that ... (the) Hang Seng index will find a very, very concrete resistance at 27,000 points," Dickie Wong, executive director at Kingston Securities, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Wednesday. "In terms of the local economy, it's still sluggish so I don't really see a real rebound in the short term." Michael Yoshikami, founder and CEO of Destination Wealth Management, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Thursday that the "damage has been done." "While I think this certainly appears to be a positive step forward toward some sort of resolution, I think the impact is going to be felt in Hong Kong," he said. "I think that is going to be something that we're going to be dealing with for a significant period of time, months, for sure." In mainland China, shares saw gains on the day. The Shanghai composite gained 0.96% to about 2,985.86, while the Shenzhen component rose 0.86% to 9,783.50 and Shenzhen composite added 0.93% to around 1,651.63.
