The average price of a gallon of regular-grade gasoline dropped 7 cents nationally over the past two weeks to $2.54. Industry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday that the spike comes despite a jump in oil prices. The current gas price is 34 cents above where it was a year ago. Gas in San Francisco was the highest in the contiguous United States at an average of $3.26 a gallon. The lowest was in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at $2.18 a gallon. The U.S. average diesel price is $2.88, holding steady from two weeks ago.
