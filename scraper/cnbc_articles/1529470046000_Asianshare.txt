China said in response that it would take counter measures against the U.S. if the latter went ahead with issuing the list of extra tariffs. "Markets have been bracing for a not ideal outcome ... so it's been a big dampening impact on sentiment," Steven Wieting, chief investment strategist at Citi Private Bank, told CNBC's "Squawk Box." "Generally speaking, the world has treated this trade war as an unknown negative that's impacting markets widely when it's likely to be much more specific to certain companies and have significant impact â€” and the U.S. is far from immune to the negatives here," Wieting added.
