S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures also pointed to losses. "In light of disappointing revenue and outlook guidance from Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN) yesterday, it appears the U.S. futures market is continuing the after-hours selloff in those names, and tech stocks generally, that began after their quarterly reports," Michael Cuggino, president and portfolio manager at Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds, told CNBC by email. "This activity drives home the point that it remains an open question as to what degree the U.S. market, in which many names are already in correction mode, may fall further," Cuggino said.

"Furthermore, higher input costs, resulting from an ongoing trade war and tightened monetary stance, is likely to harm corporate profit and this might further weigh on market sentiment," she added. In other news, The European Central Bank also left its benchmark interest rates unchanged on Thursday, something that one market observer said was not unexpected. "As expected, the ECB left rates on hold and made no changes to its forward guidance, the Bank is still set to end its quantitative easing programme at the end of the year and rates are still expected to remain on hold 'through the summer of 2019'," Rodrigo Catril, a senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank, said in a morning note. "The Euro was briefly boosted by Draghi's comments, reaching an overnight high of 1.1432, but it seems that the market remains unconvinced on Draghi's views that the risk to the outlook remain "broadly balanced," he said, in reference to comments made by ECB President Mario Draghi.
