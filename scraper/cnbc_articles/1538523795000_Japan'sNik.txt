"If you look at Japan, the economy's sort of improving and it's not subject to the U.S. trade war right now," Kevin Leung, an executive director of investment strategy at Haitong International Securities, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Wednesday morning.

Shares of major Japanese automakers fell on the back of poor September auto sales in the U.S., with Toyota falling by 2.94 percent while Honda saw losses of 4.25 percent on Wednesday.

"I don't think it's quite that bad, only because it's compared to last September which was a really high month because of the replacement demand from Hurricane Harvey and you see that when you look at the (seasonally adjusted annual rate)," Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book, told CNBC's "Street Signs" Wednesday. The seasonally adjusted annual rate refers to a rate adjustment applied to data in a bid to remove the impact of seasonal variations.
