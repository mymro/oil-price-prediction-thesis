Living the American dream means being financially comfortable and living in a place you love — and can afford. In this turbocharged economy, more people are looking to relocate nationwide in search of better job opportunities, lower tax havens and places that offer their families a better quality of life. To help you determine which states are currently the most affordable — based on cost of living, the price of housing, energy, food prices and other prices of goods and services — one can turn to CNBC's exclusive annual America's Top States for Business study. The cost of living in the U.S. varies widely from state to state. In urban areas, especially, the cost of housing, food, taxes and other expenses can be exorbitant. In other areas your dollar can go a long way. A state with a low cost of living can be a great draw for companies looking to attract workers. That is why Cost of Living is one of the 10 categories of competitiveness in our rankings. We score all 50 states based on an index of items ranging from groceries to housing. These are the 10 states where your money goes the furthest, along with average prices for some basic items in each state's most expensive area. Price data is based on the 2018 Annual Average Cost of Living Index by the Council for Community and Economic Research. Here are the 10 cheapest states, along with average prices for some items in the most expensive metro areas.
