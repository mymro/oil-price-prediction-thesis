Meanwhile, bushfires are set to affect the country's major dairy industry, with fire-affected regions accounting for around a third of Australia's output, according to a Reuters report. Australia is the world's seventh-largest dairy exporter. Shares of Australia's largest processor Bega Cheese fell as much as 10% on Monday, but pared losses on Tuesday to rise 2.81% by the close.

Overall, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.74%. Gold prices on Tuesday retreated from its near seven-year high on Monday â€” as investors fled riskier assets amid U.S.-Iran tensions that shot up in the past week with the killing of Iran's top commander Qasem Soleimani. Spot gold fell 0.2% to $1,562.81 per ounce. Oil prices also retreated on Tuesday, losing more than 1% before paring losses in the afternoon. They were higher earlier this week on the back of those geopolitical risks. In the afternoon during Asia hours, U.S. crude dropped 0.81% to $62.77 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent dropped back below $70, declining 0.90% to $68.29 per barrel. "Geopolitical tensions remain centre stage with markets clearly in wait-and-see mode," Tapas Strickland, director of economics and markets at National Australia Bank, wrote in a note on Tuesday. "The potential for this to spiral into a cycle of retaliation remains and markets will likely remain cautious," Strickland said, referring to U.S.-Iran tensions. U.S. markets rose on Monday, recovering from losses earlier on Friday, with gains led by big tech stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 68.50 points, or 0.2% at 28,703.38 after falling 216 points earlier in the day. The S&P 500 closed 0.4% higher at 3,246.28 while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.6% to 9,071.46.
