And we have watched that movie before.""Finally, there is a nagging sense that a preliminary agreement here is likely to fall short of the "comprehensive deal" Trump banged on about at the G20," he added.The new round of talks began on Monday as the two countries seek to strike an agreement amidst the ongoing trade war, which saw the U.S. and China slap punitive tariffs on each other's goods.The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 95.777 after seeing highs above 96 in the previous session.The Japanese yen, widely seen as a safe-haven currency, traded at 108.97 against the greenback after seeing an earlier high of 108.66 yesterday.
