The moves on Wall Street came as Powell said the U.S. central bank is assessing whether current economic uncertainties call for lower rates. Powell noted the Fed will take a wait-and-see approach given how rapid recent economic changes have been, but added the Fed is "insulated from short-term political interests. " One strategist said Powell's comments had left the market "none the wiser in terms of whether or not the Fed will look to embark on a new easing cycle at the end of July." "While the word 'patience' was dropped in the (Federal Open Market Committee) statement, it seems that Powell is still on a wait and see mode noting that much will depend on the incoming data and specifically the near-term risks (which we take to mean upcoming trade discussions)," Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank, wrote in a note. Meanwhile, investors looked toward developments on the U.S.-China trade front, with presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping set to meet at the G-20 summit later this week. "We should at least end up in a situation where the U.S. and China are at least talking to each other," Manpreet Gill, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities investment strategy at Standard Chartered Private Bank, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Wednesday. On the subject of a potential deal being reached, Gill said it "might be a stretch too far" given "how far apart" the two parties are at present. "A resumption of dialogue, resumption to at least start talking about some of the more difficult issues, we think will be enough for markets to at least ... take this outcome positively," he said.
