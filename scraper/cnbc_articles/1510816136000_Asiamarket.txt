Asian equities shrugged off the softer lead from Wall Street to close higher on Thursday as oil eked out slight gains during Asian trade. The Nikkei 225 bounced 1.47 percent, or 322.8 points, to close at 22,351.12 to snap a six-day losing streak as financials, retailers and most tech names rose. Fast Retailing closed up 1.42 percent, Nintendo gained 3.95 percent and SoftBank advanced 2.21 percent on the day. Energy-related plays traded mixed. South Korea's benchmark Kospi index tacked on 0.63 percent by 3:00 p.m. HK/SIN. Trading hours had been pushed back by an hour on Thursday. Blue-chip tech names and manufacturing stocks were mostly higher, with Samsung Electronics advancing 0.87 percent. Energy-related stocks also climbed as refinery company S-Oil rose 2.13 percent by 2:58 p.m. HK/SIN. Down Under, the S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.16 percent to close at 5,943.51 with the heavily-weighted banking sub-index climbing 0.13 percent in the session. The energy sub-index jumped 1.89 percent on the day after taking a beating earlier in the week following the declines in oil prices. The positive sentiment was also mirrored in greater China markets.

Investors also focused on the likelihood of proposed tax reforms getting passed before year-end. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 138.19 points, or 0.59 percent, to close at 23,271.28 — its lowest finish in more than three weeks. Oil prices inched higher after declining on Wednesday when a U.S. government agency report showed the build in crude stockpiles was larger than estimated. U.S. West Texas Intermediate rose 0.13 percent to trade at $55.40 per barrel and Brent crude futures traded 0.24 percent higher at $62.02. Stateside, the closely-watched consumer price index rose by just 0.1 percent in October compared to the 0.5 percent rise seen in September, which was in line with a forecast from economists in a Reuters poll. Other U.S. data released on Wednesday included retail sales, which edged up 0.2 percent in October. That was above a Reuters poll in which economists had expected the metric to be unchanged, but still softer than the 1.9 percent rise in September. Following those releases, the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies at 93.803 at 2:47 p.m. HK/SIN after trading as low as the 93.4 handle on Wednesday. The greenback, meanwhile, was firmer against the Japanese currency, with the dollar last trading at 113.05 yen. Investors also kept an eye on the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which was at its flattest in 10 years as markets anticipated a December interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.

Shares of Santos popped, rising 13.01 percent by the end of the session. The company said it had rejected a takeover bid from Harbour Energy in August and had not received a current proposal. The company's announcement came after the Australian Financial Review reported earlier in the day that the oil and gas company was the target of a proposed 11 billion Australian dollar ($8.34 billion) takeover. Elsewhere, Yixin Group, a Tencent-backed online platform for car sales, made its debut in Hong Kong on Thursday.
