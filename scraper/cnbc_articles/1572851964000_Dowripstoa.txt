President Donald Trump touted the records, saying in a tweet: "Stock Market hits RECORD HIGH. Spend your money well!""The market rally is now broadening out, meaning it's not just confined to tech and we'll likely go a little bit higher," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. "It's based on a lot of enthusiasm that continues to build around trade." U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Sunday that American firms would be granted licenses to sell to Chinese telecom giant Huawei "very shortly." Ross' comments came after China said Friday it reached a consensus with the U.S. in principle following trade talks last week.China and the U.S. have been engaged in a trade war for more than a year, but expectations for a deal being signed have increased recently.

The U.S. economy added 128,000 jobs in October, the Labor Department said Friday."We stay constructive, looking for new highs before the next US recession strikes," Mislav Matejka, head of global and European equity strategy at J.P. Morgan, wrote in a note."Historically, recessions have tended to follow the trough in the unemployment rate by a year on average," Matejka wrote. "In other words, one needs to see the unemployment rate rising for a while to believe in a sustained slowdown."Friday's jobs report also showed the U.S. labor force expanding my 325,000 last month. Meanwhile, those counted as being outside of the workforce dropped by 118,000 to 95.5 million."More people are being drawn back into the labor force. That, to me, is the key point," said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. "From a fundamental economic, business-cycle perspective, there is no reason to have a recession right now. Unless there is a policy mistake or miscalculation.""I can recall very few times in my career where one economic report really changed the mood music so much on Wall Street as the jobs report did," he said.Meanwhile, the corporate earnings season has largely been better than expected.
