Trump said in a tweet on Monday: "Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies. which is not good for our farmers. Therefore, effective immediately, I will restore the Tariffs on all Steel & Aluminum that is shipped into the U.S. from those countries." "Unfortunately it's all to do with the election next year," Colin Graham, chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions at Eastspring Investments, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Tuesday. "This is about ... gaining the votes and so he can secure a second term ... as president." The U.S. Trade Representative said Monday that it could slap tariffs of up to 100% on certain French products, adding to global trade tensions. Uncertainty also remained on the U.S.-China trade front. Trump said Monday China still wants to make a deal on trade, "but we'll see what happens." His comments came following a heating up of tensions between the two economic powerhouses last week after Trump signed two pieces of legislation supporting protesters in Hong Kong, with a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry saying Friday that Beijing will take ""strong counter-measures" against Washington. "We expect that a narrow deal around trade can be achieved, and this would be one where no new tariffs or those planned but not implemented are postponed," Kerry Craig, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, wrote in a note. "While there is a clear economic incentive from both sides to do some sort of deal, the political desire to reach more than the minimum is weak, as the two side are still going to want to compete in areas such as technology," "With an outcome that is not clear, investors are better to focus on company fundamentals and Chinese domestic names which can be backed by structural shifts in the economy," Craig said. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 97.89 after declining from highs above 98.3 yesterday.

Oil prices rose in the afternoon of Asian trading hours, with international benchmark Brent crude futures up 0.3% to $61.10 per barrel. U.S. crude futures also advanced 0.46% to $56.22 per barrel.
