Both the Dow and S&P 500 are on pace for their best weeks since November.The bulk of the market's sizable gains this week are due to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said on Tuesday the Fed will "act as appropriate to sustain the expansion," opening the door to rate cuts.Powell's comments are "helpful and the markets are expecting some rate cuts," said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. "The current data isn't the problem; it's the forecasts. The impact of what trade might do to the outlook has the attention of the Fed. It's a highly fluid situation because we don't know how any resolution on trade and tariffs will turn out. But to the extent that it affects the real economy, the Fed is willing to cut."Traders are now pricing in a more than 90% chance of a September rate cut and about 60% probability of three rate cuts this year, according to the CME FedWatch tool. They hope an easing of monetary policy will make up for the damage to the economy inflicted by the trade battles with Mexico and China."Trump's surprise threat to impose tariffs on Mexico has broadened the trade dispute beyond China. The drag from increased trade tensions is starting to show up in weaker economic data," said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note.Trump ratcheted up tensions with China on Thursday, telling reporters that tariffs on Chinese goods could be raised by another $300 billion if necessary.â€”CNBC's Elliot Smith contributed to this report.
