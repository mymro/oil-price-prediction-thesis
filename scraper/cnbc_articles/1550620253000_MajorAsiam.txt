Both countries have until then to come up with a deal. Otherwise, additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese products could take effect. Trump indicated last week, however, he would be willing to push back the deadline."If we do have that deadline pushed out, it at least allows the two parties to reach a sort of framework for agreeing something around those more structural, difficult long-term issues," Isaac Poole, chief investment officer at Oreana Financial Services, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Wednesday.An agreement between the U.S. and China around issues such as the trade deficit and currency stabilization are the "easiest" parts for the two parties to achieve, Poole said."Things like intellectual property transfer and those longer term structural issues, they're going to take longer than 60 days. They're going to take longer than 90 days to reach an agreement," he added.Also on Tuesday, Bloomberg News reported that the U.S. is requesting that China keep the yuan stable as part of the trade deal.The move would be aimed at mediating any effort by the Chinese to devalue the yuan to counter American tariffs, people familiar with the situation told Bloomberg News.

China's current account surplus has collapsed to only 0.4% of GDP in 2018 and interest rate spreads have narrowed," Capurso said.The Australian dollar was at $0.7163 after bouncing from lows below $0.712 yesterday."Unsurprisingly, what is good for (the offshore Chinese yuan) is also good for (the Australian dollar) given the strong trade links between China and Australia," Capurso said.Copper prices advanced to their highest levels since Jul. 2018.
