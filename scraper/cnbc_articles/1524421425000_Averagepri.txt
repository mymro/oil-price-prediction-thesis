The average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline spiked 9 cents a gallon over the past two weeks to $2.83. Industry analyst Trilby Lundberg said Sunday that the jump was driven primarily by rising crude oil costs. The current gas price is 37 cents above where it was a year ago. The highest average price in the contiguous 48 states was $3.68 in the San Francisco Bay area. The lowest was $2.45 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The average price for diesel fuel rose six cents, to $3.10.
