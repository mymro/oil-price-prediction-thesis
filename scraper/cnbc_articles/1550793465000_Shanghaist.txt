The Australian dollar traded at $0.7113 after moving wildly in the previous session, dropping from levels above $0.720. According to Kathy Lien, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, "what really killed" the rally in the Australian dollar yesterday was a Reuters report that China was banning the import of Australian coal in the northern port of Dalian. "Not only is this a big hit (2% of all Australian coal imports are destined for Dalian) for the industry but China is also getting tough on Australia after they banned Huawei from their 5G network last year," Lien said. Following the report, shares of Australian coal miners mostly sold off on Friday.

Meanwhile, officials from China and the U.S. met again in Washington on Thursday. Reports on Thursday said Washington and Beijing have begun drawing up memorandums of understanding over trade. "I think the more important question to ask is, will ... Beijing absolutely be willing to make real significant, structural and painful reforms on these key areas that for so long they've been dragging their feet on," Jude Blanchette, senior advisor and China practice lead at Crumpton Group, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday. He added that such a move would result in "pretty significant structural dislocations in China's economy as it transitions." The two economic powerhouses are attempting to strike a deal before a March 1 deadline, when additional tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S. will go into effect. U.S. President Donald Trump, however, has said in recent days it was not a "magical date," raising speculation over the possibility of the deadline being extended. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 96.555 after seeing lows below 96.4 yesterday. The Japanese yen changed hands at 110.72 against the dollar after touching an earlier high of 110.61.
