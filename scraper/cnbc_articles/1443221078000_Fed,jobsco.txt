Strong or weak, September's jobs report could sway the debate in  the week ahead about when the Federal Reserve will hike rates, while markets  also watch Washington to see if the budget battle is going to get  any worse.There is also a flock of Fed speakers making about a dozen  appearances. That includes the core of the Fed: Fed Chair  Janet Yellen, New York Fed President William Dudley and Fed Vice  Chairman Stanley Fischer. "I think the hawks will be important, but to get a nod from  Dudley and Fischer that they're ready [to hike rates], too, that's  the signal you need," said John Canally, investment strategist and economist at LPL Financial. "They're the center of gravity, along  with Yellen."
