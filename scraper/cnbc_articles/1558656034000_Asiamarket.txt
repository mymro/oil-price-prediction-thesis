Asia Pacific markets traded mixed Friday, as worries over trade tensions between the United States and China weighed on investor sentiment. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.67% in the afternoon. Mainland Chinese markets were mixed: The Shanghai composite closed flat while the Shenzhen composite fell 0.48%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added about 0.4% in late afternoon trade. In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.16% to 21,117.22 while the Topix index was fractionally higher at 1,541.21. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.69% to 2,045.31. Australia's declined 0.55% to 6,456, with the financial subindex down 0.45%. "A negative shift (in) the US-China trade negotiations took its toll on the markets," analysts at ANZ Research said in an early morning note. "China is prepared to hunker down and support its private enterprises rather than yield to the financial pressures being applied by the US." The ANZ analysts pointed out that since both sides "will only negotiate on their own terms, it could be years before the two powers can find sufficient common ground." Both Beijing and Washington have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of one another's goods since last year. The trade tensions have battered financial markets and dampened business sentiment. The situation escalated earlier this month as both sides hiked tariffs on their goods. Overnight, U.S. stocks fell as investors were concerned the trade war may last much longer than anticipated. Data also showed that manufacturing activity in the world's largest economy grew at its slowest pace since September 2009 this month.
