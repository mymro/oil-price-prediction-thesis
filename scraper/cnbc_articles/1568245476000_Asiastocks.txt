The moves in the region came as U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that increased tariffs on 250 billion dollars worth of Chinese goods that were set to kick in on October 1 have now been delayed to October 15 "as a gesture of good will." Trump said the decision was made at the request of Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and in consideration of the 70th anniversary celebrations of the People's Republic of China. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: "At the request of the Vice Premier of China, Liu He, and due to the fact that the People's Republic of China will be celebrating their 70th Anniversary on October 1st, we have agreed, as a gesture of good will, to move the increased Tariffs on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods (25% to 30%), from October 1st to October 15th." "It's hard to know ... where things are going to go but I guess if we're trading concessions that's better than trading escalations," James McCormack, global head of sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Thursday. Still, McCormack added: "I think we're some distance from real resolution, I suspect if we're sitting here a year from now we'll still be talking about many of these issues." Investors also awaited the European Central Bank's decision on interest rates, set to be announced later in the day. "There is a unanimous consensus for easing measures to be announced, but a great deal of uncertainty on what exactly these measures might entail," Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank, wrote in a morning note.
