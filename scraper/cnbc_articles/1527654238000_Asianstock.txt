Losses in Asia came on the back of political turmoil in Italy, which is expected to lead to a fresh vote in the months ahead.

For Asia, however, jitters as a result of political concerns could prove to fade in the medium term. "We are living right now a very complicated situation in Italy. For those who are living in Asia, all they need to do is simply close their eyes, move forward six months and this whole storm will disappear," Marco Elser, head portfolio manager at Lonsin Capital, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Wednesday.

Other safe-haven plays also firmed overnight, with the Japanese yen on Wednesday holding onto overnight gains to trade at 108.68 to the dollar.
