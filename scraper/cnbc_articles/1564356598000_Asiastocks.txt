Expectations for a major breakthrough are low, however, with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow telling CNBC last Friday that he "wouldn't expect any grand deal."Last Friday, strong earnings and better-than-expected GDP data pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to record highs. The S&P 500 gained 0.7% to close at 3,025.86, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.1% to finish its trading day at 8,330.21.

Of those companies, 76.4% have posted a stronger-than-forecast profit, according to FactSet. The U.S. economy also expanded more than expected in the second quarter, growing 2.1% as compared to expectations of a 1.8% rise by economists surveyed in CNBC/Moody's Analytics Rapid Update.Meanwhile, Chinese industrial profits fell in June, according the the country's National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday. Industrial profits fell 3.1% in June from a year earlier, following a 1.1% gain in May."The slowdown in profits lines up with the soft producer prices seen earlier in the month and also suggests margins are being impacted by the US-China trade war," Tapas Strickland, an economist at National Australia Bank, wrote in a morning note.The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 98.053 after rising from levels below 97.2 last week.The Japanese yen traded at 108.62 against the dollar after weakening from levels below 108 in the previous trading week, while the Australian dollar changed hands at $0.6908 after slipping from levels above $0.702 last week.Oil prices declined in the afternoon of Asian trading hours, as international benchmark Brent crude futures slipped 0.6% to $63.08 per barrel and U.S. crude futures declined 0.39% to $55.98 per barrel.— Reuters and CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.
