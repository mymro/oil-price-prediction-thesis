As geopolitical tensions in the Middle East were helped to Trump's last tweets, oil prices should have experienced a correction.

The latest data shows OPEC's strict implementation with the agreement on trimming supply make the supply and demand fundamentals improved and oil prices increased. The latest monthly report that was published by OPEC last night in Beijing time shows the member nations of OPEC have reduced the production to 31.69 million barrels per day in March, declined by 201 thousand barrels per day compared to Feb's, making it the lowest production level of OPEX in one year. And this data indicates that OPEC compliance with oil output cut deal in March reached as high as 159 percent of the record. Hitting another record highThe cooling of US-China trading friction is the 3rd reason for the increased oil prices. The logic behind this is simple. Trading conflicts may cause trade to decrease and reduce transport energy demand; On the contrary, if the global economy continues to expand and trade increases, this will drive the growth of crude oil demand. We will keep an eye on this issue.
