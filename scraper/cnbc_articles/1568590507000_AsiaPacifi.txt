Stocks in Asia Pacific were mixed on Monday, as oil prices surged following drone attacks over the weekend that hit major oil production facilities in Saudi Arabia. Mainland Chinese stocks were little changed on the day, with the Shanghai composite little changed at around 3,030.75 while the Shenzhen component was just below the flatline at 9,918.09. The Shenzhen composite added 0.23% to approximately 1,685.09. A cut in the reserve requirement ratio for banks by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) went into effect on Monday. The PBOC said in early September that its reserve requirement ratio would be cut by 50 basis points and it would further reduce that ratio by 100 basis points for some qualified banks. That's set to release 800 billion yuan ($113 billion) in liquidity into the economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed about 1%, as of its final hour of trading. Shares of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing slipped 2.16% following the rejection of its takeover bid by the London Stock Exchange Group last Friday.

Over the weekend, drone attacks hit the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil production facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels. Half the country's oil production was halted due to fire damage and an assessment of the situation is due on Monday, Saudi energy ministry officials said. National oil company Saudi Aramco is attempting to restore about a third of its crude output by Monday following the attacks, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. Strategists at Commonwealth Bank of Australia said the uptick in crude prices may not last. "The drone attacks have hit the oil market at a time when there is a global oil glut and global growth is weak," they wrote in a note. "Consequently, the impact on oil prices and global growth is not expected to be significant or last long." China's industrial production growth saw its slowest pace in 17 and a half years in August, rising just 4.4% year-on-year. That came in below a forecast of a 5.2% year-on-year increase by analysts in a Reuters poll. Industrial output growth in the country saw an expected drop to a more than 17-year low in July. "I think it is very much a bottoming process that we're seeing in the Chinese economy," Leon Goldfeld, multi-asset portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Monday. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 98.192 after seeing highs above 98.8 last week.
