The Green New Deal that Democrats proposed Thursday looks to create a more environmentally sound country with economic benefits for everyone â€” even those who don't want to work. An overview circulated by proponents states the plan seeks a "massive transformation of our society" that could rid the country of fossil fuels and "create millions of family supporting-wage [sic] union jobs." But for those not interested in working, there's something in the plan as well. The overview notes that the Green New Deal aims to provide "economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to work." While the resolution patterns itself after President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, which was aimed at rescuing the country from the Great Depression, the FDR plan did not include a proviso for those willingly idle. The Green New Deal seeks to shift the U.S. to all renewable energy in 10 years. The actual resolution that outlines the Green New Deal does not include the "unwilling to work" part, but the overview document, released by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's office, does include the "unwilling" language. The overview entails the "nuts and bolts" of the plan. Ocasio-Cortez identifies as a democratic socialist. CNBC has reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's office for comment.
