Trump is scheduled to be in London for a gathering of NATO leaders on Dec. 3 - 4, and a potential signing could happen nearby before or after that visit, people close to the talks told CNBC. Reuters first reported the meeting postponement.Those developments came after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile, originally scheduled for later this month, was canceled due to protests in the country. Trump and Xi were scheduled to meet at the summit to discuss and potentially sign a "phase one" deal."I think ... in terms of the trade deal, it looks like it's had a positive development," David Sokulsky, CEO and chief investment officer of Concentrated Leaders Fund, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Thursday. "Until we actually see something come out of it, it's very hard to know what's that gonna be."Sokulsky said a "phase one" trade deal between the two economic powerhouses "doesn't really do a whole lot" unless issues such as intellectual property protection, currency manipulation and the trade balance are addressed."Headlines suggesting that markets are worried about reports of a likely delay in US-China "Phase 1" deal to December rather than this month lack nuance, if not miss the point," Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, wrote in a note."It is not the timing (small delay) that is worrying," Varathan said. "Instead, (it is) more negotiation tensions requiring more time that an inadvertent delay may reveal and the ensuring final/finer details of an interim deal that really matter.""The ability to progress beyond the relatively low-hanging fruits of the 'Phase 1' deal will be threatened to a greater degree by pre-existing tensions at this stage, than a mere timing delay due to logistical issues," he said.Overnight stateside, stocks ended the session on Wall Street little changed.
