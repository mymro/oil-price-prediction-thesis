"China wants to do something, but I'm not doing anything yet," Trump said. "Twenty-five years of abuse. I'm not ready so fast."Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank, said Trump is digging in on the U.S.-China trade war. "He believes the trade war impacts China much more than the U.S. In his mind, you can close up the U.S. economy," he said. "At the same time, you've got China doing the same thing.""The reactions in the markets this week are maybe more of a realization that this trade war is not going to come to a quick end," Gaffney said.

He said the Federal Reserve will be pushed towards aggressive easing measures if President Donald Trump keeps pressuring China.
