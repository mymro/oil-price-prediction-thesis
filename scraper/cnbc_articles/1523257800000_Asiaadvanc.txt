Markets have focused on the escalation in trade-related rhetoric between the U.S. and China in recent weeks, although fears appeared to have eased during Asian trade. "[T]rade war fears are not as intense as they were last week," Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, said in an early note. U.S. stocks came under pressure in the last session after President Donald Trump said he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on Chinese goods. In response, China's Ministry of Commerce said on Friday that it would "fight back with a major response" if the U.S. went ahead with its plan. Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that China would remove its trade barriers as that would be the "right thing to do." Markets also awaited Chinese President Xi Jinping's Tuesday speech at the Boao Forum. Investors have been on edge over how heightened trade tensions between the world's two largest economies could result in a potential trade war. That could, in turn, dent global economic growth and corporate profits. Some analysts, however, saw the escalation as a part of Trump's negotiating tactics and are hopeful about talks between the two countries. "[W]e are starting to see a lessening in the severity of the moves, especially in the foreign exchange market where the market is looking for confirmation of action before committing to a trend," Rakuten Securities Australia said in a note.
