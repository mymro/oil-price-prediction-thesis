On Sunday, President Donald Trump doubled-down on his rhetoric on Twitter, calling on other countries to end all trade barriers or face a new round of retaliatory measures. Last week, Trump requested the United States Trade Representative identify $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for potential additional tariffs at a rate of 10 percent. That threat followed levies announced by both nations earlier in the month. Consequently, Beijing said it could deliver its own set of new counter measures. The uncertainty over a trade war, and the tit-for-tat dispute between the two countries, sent markets around the globe on a roller-coaster ride last week. Still, reports suggested that some White House officials were trying to restart talks with China to avoid a full-blown trade war. "What is clear from weekend developments is that U.S. President Trump is unlikely to stop any time soon on his tariffs threats," analysts at Singapore's OCBC Bank said in a Monday morning note. "China's policymakers are stepping up to counter the tariff tantrum with domestic stimulus measures." Indeed, the People's Bank of China said on Sunday that it would cut the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves by 50 basis points, releasing $108 billion in liquidity, to spur lending to smaller firms, according to Reuters. The Chinese central bank said the targeted cut will take effect on July 5, the report said.
