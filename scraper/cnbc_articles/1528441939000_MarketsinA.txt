"While there are no obvious catalysts for an apparent broadening of emerging market (albeit excluding Asia) pressures in recent days, it is valid to speculate that the European Central Bank's mid-week signalling that the conditions for ending its quantitative easing bond buying program look to have fallen into place, is relevant," Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank, said in a note. The ECB's chief economist said earlier in the week that underlying strength in the euro area was making the central bank confident about inflation moving toward target, adding that the institution would discuss how it will wind down its asset-purchasing program next week. Apart from the ECB, investors also awaited the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting, which is due to take place over two days next week. Trade developments also continued to feature prominently, with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross telling CNBC that a deal had been reached with Chinese telecommunications equipment maker ZTE, which had been crippled after U.S. companies were blocked from selling to it. The deal will impose a $1 billion penalty on ZTE, which will also need to install a U.S.-chosen compliance team, but is facing some pushback from U.S. lawmakers. Investors will also turn their attention to the G-7 summit taking place in Canada on Friday and Saturday, with the issues related to protectionism and international trade expected to take center stage.

On the energy front, oil prices pared some overnight gains after advancing in the last session on investor worries about a drop in Venezuelan exports.
