Asia Pacific shares mostly rose in the afternoon, as latest figures showed that South Korea's economy continued to slow. Investors, meanwhile, look ahead to the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday. Mainland Chinese markets moved to a subdued finish. The Shanghai composite closed flat to 2,940.92, while the Shenzhen composite declined 0.21% to 1,615.96. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index bucked the trend, jumping 0.77% in its final hour of trade.

Exports remain sluggish on the back of slowing global growth, which dampens commodities prices," wrote Mizuho Bank's Zhu Huani in a note. She added that the central bank may also want to spur demand for loans, which has seen limited growth. Investors will also await the European Central Bank's (ECB) meeting, set to take place on Thursday. It's the final one for current President Mario Draghi, who will end his eight-year term at the ECB at the end of the month. Expectations are low for any new policy announcements Thursday — six weeks after the central bank unveiled a massive stimulus package. Brexit developments continued to dominate overnight. Media reports in the U.K. suggest that Downing Street will push for an election if the Brexit deadline is delayed until the end of January next year. Meanwhile, the EU has to decide if it would grant the extension. One EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, told CNBC that EU leaders could decide on the delay as early as Thursday.
