The Nasdaq Composite gained less than 0.1% to 8,570.70. Investors awaited the release of the U.S. government's monthly nonfarm payrolls report expected on Friday stateside. That would come following a disappointing private payrolls number released Wednesday, and also on the back of the Labor Department saying Thursday that U.S. weekly jobless claims dropped 203,000 last week â€” the lowest in seven months. "With the (U.S. Federal Reserve) pretty much having exhausted its 'insurance cuts' and markets almost unanimously expecting the Fed to be on a purposeful pause, it is safe to say that U.S. nonfarm payroll will be relegated to the backseat," Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank wrote in a note. "Instead the obsession will be with tariff rollback!" Varathan said. "Specifically, whether or not White House trade negotiators will relent to offer China tariff rollback, which appears to have been established as Beijing's precondition to strike a phase-one trade deal." Reuters reported Friday that China's finance ministry said the country will waive import tariffs for certain soybean and pork shipments from the U.S., without providing further detail. Markets have seen a rocky start to December amid conflicting headlines on the U.S.-China trade front ahead of a closely watched date of Dec. 15 when additional tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. go into effect. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Washington and Beijing are still in disagreement over the size of China's agriculture purchases. Meanwhile, China has given little indication on how negotiations with the U.S. are progressing. Earlier in the week, markets were sent into a frenzy after U.S. President Donald Trump said he may delay a trade deal with China till after the 2020 U.S. presidential election. "I think the markets are taking consolation that at least this is not escalating and trade talks have not broken down, talks are still going on and there's still hope," Vasu Menon, executive director of investment strategy at Singapore's OCBC Bank told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Friday. Still, Menon acknowledged that "clearly there are disagreements" between the two economic powerhouses, be it the U.S. demands for China to purchase more U.S. agricultural products or Beijing's desire to see Washington roll back tariffs. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 97.374 after slipping from levels above 98.0 earlier in the trading week. The Japanese yen traded at 108.64 per dollar after strengthening from levels above 108.8 yesterday. The Australian dollar changed hands at $0.6842 after rising from levels below $0.678 earlier in the week. Oil prices were largely unchanged in the afternoon of Asian trading hours, with international benchmark Brent crude futures hovering around the flatline at $63.40 per barrel. U.S. crude futures was largely flat at $58.42 per barrel.
