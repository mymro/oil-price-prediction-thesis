Shares of Royal Dutch Shell dipped 0.7% in trade Friday after the firm announced that it will book additional charges against its income in the fourth quarter. The Anglo-Dutch energy giant said it expects to log a fourth-quarter impairment charge ranging between $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion after tax. Details on the impairment were not provided. Swiss bank UBS described the range as "relatively small," although noted other charges which, when added on, would depress fourth-quarter earnings by around $3 billion in total.

Production of oil and gas is expected to rise from the third quarter. Upstream oil production is forecast to sit between 2,775 and 2,825 thousand barrels of oil per day.
