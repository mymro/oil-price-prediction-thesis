Honeywell reported a higher-than-expected profit for the first quarter on Friday and lifted its full-year earnings forecast for the second time this year, citing higher sales in its aerospace business. Shares of the company, which makes everything from jet engines to thermostats, were up 2.6 percent at $151.92 in premarket trading. Honeywell's aerospace business, its biggest, benefited from a rise in global travel as it sold more aircraft parts and services to the commercial airline industry. Sales in the division, which makes parts for Boeing and Airbus planes, rose about 12 percent to $3.98 billion, while margins expanded by 10 basis points to 22.5 percent. The company said it now expects 2018 profit of $7.85 to $8.05 per share, compared with previous forecast of $7.75-$8.00.

Morris Plains, New Jersey-based Honeywell is also benefiting from an increase in demand from oil and gas customers in the wake of improving oil prices. The company also makes supply chain and warehouse automation equipment and software, a unit that has been gaining from a boom in ecommerce.
