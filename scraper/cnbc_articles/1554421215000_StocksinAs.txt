Liu led a delegation to Washington this week to meet with U.S. officials for another round of high-level negotiations as the two sides seek to end a potentially devastating trade conflict.One analyst, however, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Friday that any deal that emerges is unlikely to be as "comprehensive as Donald (Trump) would like to tell us," nor would it "iron out all the problems.""Remember, we've had ... the big (North American Free Trade Agreement) change which basically was a name change. We've had the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, how did that work out? You know, Trump promises big things, and he says we'll get a deal, and yes there will be some movement. But I think, you know, the fundamental way that (the) Chinese run their economy is not going to be changing anytime soon," said Fraser Howie, an independent analyst."The trade deal has already been priced in, probably around 80 percent," Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at SEB, told CNBC's "Capital Connection" on Friday. "At this point, I wouldn't be so excited considering that it's basically the same headline in the last few weeks and they're just kicking the can down the road.""Until there is a specific date I wouldn't really be that optimistic. Even so, the last 10% ... of the trade negotiations are really the tricky part," Victorino said.The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 97.217 after touching an earlier high of 97.327.The Japanese yen, widely seen as a safe-haven currency, traded at 111.64 against the dollar after seeing an earlier low of 111.79.
