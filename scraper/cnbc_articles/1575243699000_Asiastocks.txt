The key part of that deal will be that the U.S. plan to increase tariffs on Dec. 15 probably will be shelved.""I think maybe there could be a (tariff) rollback on say the September tariff increase and any deal is likely to include some sort of schedule for tariff reduction going into the future, conditional on the terms of the deal being met," he added.The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 98.316 after spiking to levels above 98.4 late last week.The Japanese yen traded at 109.62 against the dollar after weakening from levels below 108.9 last week.
