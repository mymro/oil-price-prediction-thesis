The U.S. economy added 196,000 jobs in March, according to government data released Friday, beating economists' prediction of 175,000 jobs. The strong jobs print for March "really killed the fears that people had a month ago" "I think that really killed the fears that people had a month ago after that 20,000 number," Richard Jerram, chief economist at Bank of Singapore, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday, in reference to concerns that the U.S. economy was "falling off a cliff" after the previous jobs data showed growth of just 20,000 in February. That number was revised higher to 33,000 in the March report. Jerram described calls for rate cuts or more stimulus as "crazy." "The economy is still in ... really good shape," he said, characterizing the slowdown in the U.S. economy as "moderate at worst." "With the most recent payrolls data, the positive, non-inflationary growth story continues for the U.S.," Jack Chambers from ANZ Research said in a morning note. U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that the U.S. economy would climb like "a rocket ship" if the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, following the strong jobs report. "The Fed remains firm that monetary policy will continue to be set along established, independent lines with the Fed currently data dependent," Chambers said. Investors also continued to monitor developments on U.S.-China trade. On Saturday, Chinese official broadcaster CCTV reported that there was "new progress" in trade talks that wrapped in Washington on Friday, Reuters reported. U.S. and Chinese officials were said to have discussed draft agreement text on contentious issues such as technology transfer, protection of intellectual property rights, and the bilateral trade balance, among others. "The mood music continues to be quite positive, though the market awaits a 'deal'," David de Garis, director of economics and markets at the National Australia Bank, wrote in a morning note.
