Qatar is a tiny, oil-rich country perched on the Arabian peninsula that plays an oversized role in the world's affairs. It also has had a surprisingly big and complicated part in the world of President Donald Trump. Trump accused Qatar — which hosts a key American military base — of being "a funder of terrorism at a very high level," only months after the country dropped more than $6 million for an apartment in a Trump-owned building. A year later, Qatar's leader was being warmly welcomed by the president at the White House. Also eyebrow-raising are interactions involving Qatar and major players in Trump's orbit, including his son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner, now-estranged personal lawyer Michael Cohen and top Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy. For its part, Qatar's media attache, Jassim Al-Thani, told CNBC: "Qatar is a force for stability in the region, it is GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] neighbors who have negatively impacted the security and unity of the Middle East by launching an illegal blockade against our country."
