Core Laboratories: "I think at the end of the week we have Schlumberger ... that's been a real disaster, frankly, and we're going to find out more. Let's use that as the example and make that whether we should buy Core Labs or not." Triplepoint Venture Growth: "I'm familiar with it, which is a problem because you can't be familiar with it.
