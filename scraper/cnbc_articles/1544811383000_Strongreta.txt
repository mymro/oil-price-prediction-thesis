Tracking forecasts for GDP take into account incoming data and are updated frequently.Barclays economists upped their tracking forecast Friday to 2.9 percent from 2.5 percent, mostly due to retail sales."The acceleration in sales could be partly attributed to Black Friday and other holiday-season related shopping events during this time of the year. There were also substantial upward revisions to October's data, both at the headline and core level. Taken together, this morning's report points to stronger momentum in retail sales than what we had expected, and bodes well for Q4 consumption spending," they wrote.Consumption added 0.5 percent to GDP, but the Barclays economists raised growth by just 0.4 percentage points because the strong pickup in sales suggests a fall in inventories. Barclays also trimmed 0.1 percentage points due to lowered retail inventories.
