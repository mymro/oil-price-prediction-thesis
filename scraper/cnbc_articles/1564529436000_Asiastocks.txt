China's factory activity contracted for the third straight month in July, according to official data released earlier on Wednesday. The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for July came in at 49.7, according to data from the Chinese statistics bureau. Economists polled by Reuters had expected factory activity in China to edge up to 49.6 from June's reading of 49.4. A PMI reading above 50 indicates expansion, while those below that signal contraction. U.S. President Donald Trump said in a series of tweets Tuesday that China is not keeping its promise of buying more U.S. agricultural products. For its part, China insists that it has bought U.S. agricultural products. Trump's comments come as U.S.-China trade talks are happening in Shanghai from July 30 and 31, as the two economic powerhouses aim to reach a deal to end a protracted trade war. Meanwhile, the Fed is set to deliver its decision on interest rates later Wednesday stateside, with expectations that it will cut interest rates by a quarter point. Investors will also look for clues from Powell about potential rate cuts later this year. Currently, traders are pricing in at least two rate cuts of 25 basis points before the end of the year, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. "The Fed has given us zero reason to expect anything except a quarter point rate cut so the change in interest rates will be the least market moving part of the (Federal Open Market Committee) announcement," Kathy Lien, managing director of foreign exchange strategy, wrote in a note. "Instead, US dollar traders should be focused on the votes and forward guidance," Lien said. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 98.034 after slipping from levels above 98.1 yesterday. The Japanese yen, often seen as a safe-haven currency, traded at 108.55 against the dollar after strengthening from levels above 108.8 in the previous session.
