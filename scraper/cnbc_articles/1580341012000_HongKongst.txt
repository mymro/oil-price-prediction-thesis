Markets in China remained closed on Thursday for a holiday. Investors continued to watch for developments on the ongoing coronavirus outbreak that has already taken 170 lives and infected more than 7,700 in China, according to the latest update by China's National Health Commission. "A lot of people have already moved into the very defensive areas that they can do," Andrew Sullivan, director at Pearl Bridge Partners, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Thursday. "I think longer-term wise, we know the markets are going to recover, but nobody wants to ... start jumping in until there's some certainty there." Overnight stateside, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 11.6 points higher at 28,734.45 while the S&P 500 declined less than 0.1% to 3,273.40. The Nasdaq Composite also shed less than 0.1% to 9,275.16. The Federal Open Market Committee held the overnight benchmark rate in a range between 1.5% and 1.75%, as expected. In a statement, the committee said the direction of rate policy is predicated on whether inflation can return to its 2% objective, adding that the labor market remains "strong" while the economy is growing at a "moderate rate." Commenting on the coronavirus outbreak, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is closely monitoring the situation. "There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and possibly globally based on the spread of the virus to date and the travel restrictions and business closures that have already been imposed," Powell told reporters at a press conference, though he acknowledged that it's too early to speculate on the potential economic impact globally. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 98.061 after seeing an earlier low of 97.995. The Japanese yen traded at 108.86 per dollar after seeing levels above 109.2 yesterday. The Australian dollar changed hands at $0.6731 after declining from levels above $0.676 yesterday.
