Investors watched for developments in U.S.-China trade amid renewed jitters after Bloomberg News reported Thursday, citing sources, that Chinese officials have been casting doubt over the possibility of a long-term trade deal with the U.S. The report added Chinese officials are concerned about U.S. President Donald Trump's "impulsive nature" and the risk of him backing out of any kind of deal. That development came amid recent optimism for a "phase one" deal to be signed between the two economic powerhouses soon. The deal had been initially been expected to be signed at a November summit in Chile, an event which has since been canceled by the country due to ongoing anti-government protests.
