GE also plans to reduce its net debt by about $25 billion by 2020 and generate $500 million or more in cost savings by the end of 2020. "We are upgrading shares to perform rating from underperform, based on potential for portfolio plan to unlock some value, and diminish liabilities," Glynn wrote to clients. "GE can reduce net leverage by $25 billion by 2020, from Healthcare liability transfer (debt and pension) allocation of $18 billion gross and meaningful planned liquidity from break-up moves." Shares rose 4.1 percent Wednesday following the upgrade from Oppenheimer.
