The report sent Treasury yields higher, adding to investor concerns that interest rates may be rising too fast. One analyst said the move in the U.S. market still had some way to go — and that the pullback would continue to affect most equity markets. "The past week has seen shares come under pressure as Fed rate hike expectations increased, partly reflecting an acceleration in U.S. wages growth, and the bond yield rose sharply," Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital, said in a Monday morning note. "It's likely the pullback has further to go as investors adjust to more Fed tightening than currently assumed — we see four (or possibly five) Fed rate hikes this year against market expectations for three — and higher bond yields," he added.

On the data front, China's services sector expanded at its fastest pace in almost six years, according to a private survey, Reuters reported.
