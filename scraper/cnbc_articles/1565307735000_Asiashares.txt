That was much better than a median forecast for 0.4% growth.Compared against the previous quarter, gross domestic product gained 0.4%, also beating expectations.Capital expenditure also rose 1.5% against the previous quarter, while private consumption grew 0.6%."The numbers were quite above consensus and I think, in particular, the large contribution from the domestic demand part of the economy was particularly robust," Kathy Matsui, vice chair and chief Japan strategist at Goldman Sachs Japan, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" shortly after the data release."We had at Goldman, an above consensus view but ... it came in even above that estimate and I think that kind of underscores the reality, at least from our point of view, that both consumption and private (capital expenditure) remain kind of the engines of Japan's economy at least for the foreseeable future." Matsui said.China's consumer price index in July rose 2.8% on-year — its fastest year-on-year pace since February 2018, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. In particular, food prices soared in July to 9.1% from a year ago, amid surging prices of pork as the country battles African swine fever.The producer price index for that period fell more than expected. It declined 0.3% year-on-year in July, the largest decline in annual terms since August 2016, Reuters reported.Meanwhile, the People's Bank of China fixed its midpoint for the yuan at 7.0136 against the dollar on Friday — the second time this week the benchmark rate was set weaker than 7.

Lowe's comments came on the back of a larger than expected rate cut by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Tuesday.Oil prices were largely unchanged in the afternoon of Asian trading hours.
