Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Thursday it would delay its first post-crisis interest rate hike till at least the middle of next year. "The ECB's recent inaction in the face of rising downside risks to an already shaky economic outlook — not least from rising international trade tensions — has probably more to do with a lack of monetary policy tools, rather than with complacency," Silvia Dall'Angelo, senior economist at Hermes Investment Management, wrote in a note. "For all the reassurances that its toolbox is plentiful, the ECB has little ammunition left to fight low inflation," Dall'Angelo said. The euro last traded at $1.1260, after touching highs around $1.13 yesterday. Draghi's comments come on the back of comments earlier this week from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said Tuesday the central bank will "act as appropriate to sustain the expansion," opening the door to rate cuts.
