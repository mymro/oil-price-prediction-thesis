That move came despite past objections by China amid ongoing trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington for an anticipated "phase one" deal. Hong Kong's government on Thursday voiced strong opposition to the move, saying it will send the wrong signal to protesters, Reuters reported. "I don't think it makes (the deal) less likely," Todd Mariano, U.S. director at Eurasia Group, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Thursday. "It's certainly an unwanted speed bump, i think, for the White House as it's trying to close out this deal." "Hong Kong being such an issue of strategic national significance … for China and Trump having facing such an overwhelming vote in Congress, you know, puts him in a very difficult spot … on an issue that is extremely sensitive for the Chinese leadership," Mariano said. Market sentiment has gotten a boost in recent days amid positive rhetoric on the U.S.-China trade front. On Tuesday, Trump said negotiators were close to reaching an initial trade deal. Trump's upbeat comments on trade followed a phone call between officials from the U.S. and China. The negotiators agreed to keep working on remaining issues. "I think at the moment, right now, the markets are still giving the benefit of the doubt," Ken Wong, Asia equity portfolio specialist at Eastspring Investments, told CNBC's "Capital Connection" on Thursday. "You're not only hearing some positive or strong signals coming from the U.S. but you're also hearing some strong signals coming from China as well," Wong said. "The markets are anticipating, hopefully in the next couple of months, we do get an agreement in place." Overnight stateside, stocks rose in yet another record session. The S&P 500 added 0.4% to close at 3153.64 while the Nasdaq Composite ended its trading day 0.7% higher at 8705.18. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 42.32 points to close at 28,164.
