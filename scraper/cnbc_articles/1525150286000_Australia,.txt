Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed a cache of files obtained from Iran proves the country ran a secret program to build nuclear weapons. However, the trove of data did not contain new information that was not known to diplomats who negotiated the landmark Iran nuclear deal in 2015. Iran-watchers said the press conference appeared calculated to embolden Trump to scrap the accord. "Investors were spooked by reports that an Israeli intelligence report suggested Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program," Daniel Hynes, a senior commodity strategist at ANZ, wrote in a morning note. "This comes at a sensitive time, with the U.S. President required to ratify the Iran nuclear deal " Netanyahu's remarks come less than two weeks before U.S. President Donald Trump must decide whether to continue suspending sanctions against Iran under that deal, or restore the penalties on one of the world's biggest oil producers.
