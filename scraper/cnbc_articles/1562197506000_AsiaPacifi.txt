Investors will now be watching for the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, set to be released stateside on Friday. "The U.S. non-farm payrolls report is always a big mover for the U.S. dollar and all of the major currencies but this month's report could be more market moving than usual," Kathy Lien, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, wrote in a note. "Last month, the Federal Reserve said they are close to cutting interest rates but how quickly they move depends on data. In that case, there's no single economic report as important as the jobs report," Lien said. "If job growth falls short of expectations, the market could immediately move to pricing in a July interest rate cut."

But Neil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Thursday: "We still think it's 50-50 ... that the U.S. and China eventually face off on trade ... and technology." "The postponing of it doesn't mean it's an all-clear," he added.
