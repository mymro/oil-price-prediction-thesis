Shares in Asia were higher on Monday, as investors reacted to Hong Kong's district council elections amid months of civil unrest in the city.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index led gains among major markets regionally as it jumped 1.5% to close at 26,993.04, with shares of life insurer AIA surging 3.62%.

"Here is a very clear sign, three million Hong Kongers came out in a very orderly fashion, made their votes and sent a very clear signal to the establishment.""The message has been sent across the board, across almost every â€¦ constituency, is that there is great distrust and frustration with the government and with (Hong Kong Chief Executive) Carrie Lam," Howie said.Mainland Chinese stocks were mixed on the day.

"That's got a political element as well."The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 98.179 after rising from levels below 98.0 on Friday.The Japanese yen traded at 108.87 against the dollar after seeing an earlier high of 108.62.
