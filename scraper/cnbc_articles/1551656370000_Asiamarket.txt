The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that the U.S. and China are "in the final stage of completing a trade deal," with Beijing offering to lower tariffs on U.S. products in categories ranging from chemicals to autos. For its part, the U.S. is considering eliminating most, if not all, of the trade sanctions placed on Chinese goods last year, according to the Journal. Following the Journal's report, Timothy Stratford, managing partner at Covington & Burling said it was a good news that the two sides could reach an agreement since the uncertainty, and the threat of additional retaliation, had been "very problematic for companies doing business with China." On the other hand, there was a lack of details about "what is in the agreement," Stratford, who was a former assistant U.S. trade representative, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday. "We haven't really heard much at all about what might be included in the agreement that would address these issues," he said.
