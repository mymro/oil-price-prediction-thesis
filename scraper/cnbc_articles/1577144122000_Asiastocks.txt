In Hong Kong, Sunny Optical declined 0.36% while Taiwan's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company dipped 0.6%. The moves came following the Cupertino-based tech giant's 1.6% stock jump on Monday stateside after Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives — Apple's biggest bull on Wall Street — raised his price target to $350 a share, 25% higher than where the stock currently trades. Overnight stateside, stocks extended their year-end rally as the three major averages all posted record closes.

News that China will cut import tariffs on a wide range of goods boosted sentiment. China's finance ministry announced starting January 1, it will lower import tariffs on over 850 products ranging from frozen pork to some types of semiconductors. However, mainland Chinese stocks tumbled on Monday following that announcement. "The move is not linked to US-China trade tensions, instead it is seen as a combination of a need from China to lower costs on import necessities such as pork and medicine, while also aimed at showing a willingness to open its economy to the rest of the world," Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank, wrote in a note. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was last at 97.685 after touching highs around 97.8 yesterday. The Japanese yen traded at 109.40 per dollar after strengthening from levels around 109.5 in the previous session. The Australian dollar changed hands at $0.6917 after rising from levels around $0.69 yesterday.
