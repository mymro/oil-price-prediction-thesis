"This would have been much more shocking a year ago (when [Brent] oil was US$50) than now (with oil at US$75)," said Hasnain Malik, head of equity research at Exotix Capital, in a note to clients. "Longer term, this event further narrows the space for countries that would benefit from cooperation with both the US (and its closest regional allies Israel, Saudi and the UAE) and Iran to chart a neutral path, and may portend a weakening of the US-EU strategic relationship," Malik said. Following the announcement, countries around the world reacted differently. While some nations in the Middle East commended the move made, U.S. allies in Europe did not. The president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, said that his country would continue to commit to the nuclear deal, according to Reuters. "Clearly, this is playing out in the energy sector," said Bill Northey, senior vice president at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. "But you've also got interest rates rising. That's impacting the rate-sensitive sectors of the market." Utilities, a sector adversely affected by higher rates, was one of the worst-performing spaces on Wednesday, sliding 0.7 percent. The 10-year Treasury yield broke above the 3 percent mark on Wednesday, a level that recently put markets on edge. The two-year note yield also traded at its highest level in nearly a decade.
