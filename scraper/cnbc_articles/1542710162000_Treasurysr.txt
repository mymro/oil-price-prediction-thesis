U.S. Treasury debt prices were higher Tuesday morning as investors fled volatile equity markets in favor of the relative safety of government debt. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was lower at around 3.05 percent, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also lower at 3.304 percent. It comes after sharp losses on Wall Street in the previous session, with technology firms tumbling amid concerns about softening demand. In addition to the drop in U.S. stocks, a weakening U.S. dollar did little to alleviate souring market sentiment. Weaker-than-anticipated economic data on Monday sapped confidence from the greenback, while oil prices fell yet again despite expectations of supply cuts from OPEC early next month. On Tuesday morning, the U.S. dollar was little changed from the previous session, trading at 96.346 against a basket of major currencies.
