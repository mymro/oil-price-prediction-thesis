U.S. stock index futures pointed to a mostly lower open Tuesday as shares of Apple dropped in premarket trading. The iPhone maker's stock fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading following a report from Taiwan's Economic Daily, citing unidentified sources, that Apple will slash its sales forecast for the iPhone X by 40 percent in the quarter to 30 million units. Apple has not publicly disclosed quarterly sales targets for the iPhone X, which went on sale in November. The company did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.
