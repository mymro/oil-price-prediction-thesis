European equity markets moved higher on Tuesday, helped by a reversal in stocks stateside. The pan-European Stoxx 600 ended provisionally 0.74 percent higher in trade, with most major bourses and sectors in positive territory. Telecoms were the best performing stocks during Tuesday, with Vodafone being the top gainer following the release of its results. The firm posted a loss of 7.8 billion euros ($8.76 billion) in the first six months of the year, but shares rose after Chief Executive Nick Read promised to reduce operating costs by 1.2 billion euros by 2021 and to review tower assets in order to drive higher returns. In other corporate news affecting the sector, Telecom Italia CEO Amos Genish has reportedly been stripped of his executive powers following an enduring tussle between two of its major shareholders, Vivendi and Elliott Management. Per Reuters, Genish's executive powers have been transferred to TIM's Chairman Fulvio Conti on a provisional basis. In individual stocks, health care firm BTG soared to the top of the pan-European benchmark after reporting an increase in its first-half pretax profit and an upgrade in earnings guidance. The firm's share price rose more 9.9 percent. Stocks stateside were initially hit by a plunge in Apple shares.

The report comes ahead of a meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Investors are keeping a close eye on oil prices, after new comments from President Donald Trump.
