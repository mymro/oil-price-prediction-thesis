The U.S. and China are set to resume trade negotiations in Washington on Wednesday, following last week's talks in Beijing. Ahead of the meeting, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the two countries "expect to make more headway" in this week's talks. Both economic powerhouses are closer to reaching a deal, according to a Wednesday report from the Financial Times. Myron Brilliant, executive vice president for international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told reporters that 90 percent of the deal is done, but the final 10 percent remains the trickiest part of the negotiations and would require trade-offs on both sides, according to the Financial Times report. "There will be a deal done this time," Sean Taylor, chief investment officer of Asia Pacific at DWS, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Wednesday. "It will be very difficult to implement but it will change sentiment and it will get both parties, you know, back (to) being more pleasant to each other and ... it will get trade going again." If a deal is reached, he said, the focus would shift toward what he termed the "trade war two" centered around the disputes on technology and intellectual property. Taylor also noted that it was "ironic that the markets are going up." "We're now getting downgrades from some of the big global agencies like the IMF on growth and yet the markets are sort of pricing in better news. I think that's quite an interesting point," Taylor said. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of its peers, was at 97.187 after seeing highs around 97.5 yesterday. The Japanese yen traded at 111.52 against the dollar after seeing highs below 111 earlier in the trading week. The Australian dollar was at $0.7113 after seeing an earlier low of $0.7051. Oil prices were higher in the afternoon of Asian trading hours. The international Brent crude futures contract gained 0.62 percent to $69.80 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures rose 0.32 percent to $62.78 per barrel. â€” CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.
