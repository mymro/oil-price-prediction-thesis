The major averages finished Q2 and the first half of the year on a high note, with the Dow and S&P posting their 10th positive quarter in 11, while the Nasdaq turned in its 8th straight quarter of gains. And a majority of Wall Street’s top strategists see no signs of a slowdown ahead. Despite growing trade tensions that rattled markets at the end of the second quarter, 71% of respondents in CNBC’s exclusive “Halftime Report Stock Survey” said they believe the will finish the year at least five percent higher than current levels. The index closed at 2,794 on Monday, so a gain of 5% would push the S&P to 2,933 - which is above its current all-time closing high of 2,872.8 hit on January 26. Just over a fifth of respondents think the S&P will end the year flat, and 7% see the index falling 5% or more. Investors who believe this bull market no longer has room to run often cite slowing earnings growth as a potential headwind for stocks. This is especially true after earnings grew 25% in the first quarter which, according to FactSet, was the fastest rate in 8 years.
