Airlines are set to report to investors how they fared during a bustling, stormy and expensive summer season, starting when Delta Air Lines releases its third-quarter earnings Thursday. The third quarter includes the busy summer travel season, but this period was more expensive for airlines to operate than last year, ramping up pressure on airline executives to show they can grow profits amid higher costs.

Fuel is generally airlines' second-largest expense after their employees' salaries. Airline stocks have lagged the broader market, despite strong demand for air travel. The NYSE Arca Airline index, which tracks 15 carriers, is down 14 percent so far this year, compared with the S&P 500's 7 percent gain. U.S. carriers have scrambled to raise revenue in the past few months as fuel prices rose. JetBlue Airways raised the fee to check a first bag by $5 to $30, a move that United Airlines, Delta and American Airlines followed. A relief for airline executives â€” but perhaps not consumers.
