One died and two were seriously injured, but expected to survive.Orsi was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound."The triplets were shot at close range by the dad multiple times as he was also pouring a flammable liquid, which we believe to be gasoline, all through house," Elmore County Sheriff Bill Franklin told AL.com.
