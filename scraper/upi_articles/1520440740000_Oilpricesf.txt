March 7 (UPI) -- U.S. crude oil and stock index figures shifted lower Wednesday amid global market fears on a trade war, the resignation of President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser and rising inventories.Brent oil futures opened at 65.56 and were trading down 23 cents at 9 a.m. EST. The April crude oil futures started the session at 62.30, and was down 22 cents.One day after Gary Cohn said he would resign his position in the White House, European markets were falling Wednesday. Cohn, a free trade advocate and former president at Goldman Sachs, had opposed Trump's plans for the proposed tariffs on aluminum and steel. Cohn's resignation announcement came after the U.S. markets closed on Tuesday. "It strengthens the case for a potential trade war," George Wilkes, an analyst at Sucden in London, told S&P Global Platts. "We are not going there yet... but the market is slightly spooked."Around 8:25 a.m. EST on Wednesday, Dow futures slumped 210 points.
