It seven Indian crew members were released earlier this month.Johnson and Rouhani are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, which begins Tuesday.The Stena Impero was seized by Iran's Revolutionary Guard on July 19 for alleged maritime violations. It followed Britain's seizure of an Iranian supertanker, the Grace 1, in Gibraltar two weeks earlier.British intelligence has blamed Tehran for drone attacks on two oil-producing areas of Saudi Arabia a week ago. Johnson has said he intends to de-escalate tensions with Iran in his meeting with Rouhani."The U.K. is attributing responsibility with a very high degree of probability to Iran for the [drone] attacks," he said.
