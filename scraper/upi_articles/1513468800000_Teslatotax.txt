Dec. 16 (UPI) -- Electric car company Tesla doesn't want its Supercharging stations used for commercial purposes, including cabs and ride-hailing businesses that include Uber and Lyft. The new policy, released Friday according to Bloomberg, also applies to cars used for commercial deliveries or government purposes worldwide. Instead Tesla wants the high-speed battery chargers available for private use. "We are continually expanding our global network of Supercharger stations to enable personal long distance travel and to provide a charging solution for those without immediate access to home or workplace charging, thereby accelerating the widespread adoption of electric vehicles," Tesla wrote. "When Superchargers are used beyond their intended purpose, it negatively impacts the availability of Supercharging services for others." Tesla said if commercial users don't comply, "we may also take additional action to protect the availability of Superchargers for their intended purpose, such as limiting or blocking your vehicle's ability to use Supercharger stations." The auto company said commercial users should "reach out to your local sales contact to explore vehicle and charging options that suit your needs." Tesla stations, which can charge vehicles in 30 minutes for a range of 130 miles, are mainly along highways but have expanded to city locations. Tesla, which began offering Supercharging stations five years ago, started 2017 with more than 5,000 Superchargers globally and plans more than 10,000 Superchargers and 15,000 Destination Charging connectors worldwide by year's end. Model S and Model X owners receive 400 kWh of free Supercharger credit -- about 1,000 miles -- each year. After the credit, Tesla says the average cost is $6 per 100 miles compared with $13 for gasoline.
