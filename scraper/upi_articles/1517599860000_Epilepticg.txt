Feb. 2 (UPI) -- The first dose of medical marijuana in the state of Texas was given Thursday to a 6-year-old epileptic girl -- marking the official start of the state's highly restricted and anticipated market for the drug.The girl, who has intractable epilepsy, was prescribed a low-THC cannabis oil, an ingredient in a marijuana plant helps a patient get medical benefits without feeling high. "For Texans suffering from intractable epilepsy, the wait for medical cannabis is finally over," said Jos√© Hidalgo, CEO of dispensary Knox Medical."This is a historic day for Texas and we will work tirelessly to uphold the trust and responsibility the state has placed in Knox Medical."Cansortium Texas, which also operates under the name Knox Medical, is one of three companies licensed by the Texas Department of Public Safety to grow and sell medical marijuana in the state, and the first to get the drug on the market.The marijuana can only be delivered to the patient or caregiver by a social worker or nurse.About 160,000 Texans have intractable epilepsy. To qualify for the medicine, Texas patients must have first tried two FDA-approved drugs and found them ineffective, and receive approval from two doctors listed on the Compassionate Use Registry of Texas, a website that connects doctors with epileptic patients.
