The price for Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, was down 0.4 percent as of 9:24 a.m. EDT to $75.08 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was down 0.5 percent to $65.19 per barrel.The price of oil has been under pressure given the potential for a trade war escalating over Washington's pursuit of tariffs.
