Nov. 2 (UPI) -- Parts of North Korea are facing a fuel shortage, and state media is blaming U.S. sanctions against Iran for the shortfall.The Kim Jong Un regime's gasoline and diesel oil shortages have forced the shutdown of state-sanctioned fuel stations, but because demand is outstripping supply, unauthorized stations are selling fuel, Radio Free Asia reported Friday. A source in North Hamgyong Province told RFA local stations in the city of Chongjin have suddenly stopped selling fuel."[Unauthorized] individuals have begun arbitrarily raising prices," the source said. Fuel is purchased in Chinese currency in North Korea, according to the report."Gasoline that sold at 8 yuan has risen to 10-12 yuan; diesel oil that sold at 6 yuan has risen to 8 to 9 yuan," the source said.A second source in the same province said fuel stations that remain open are anxious because "they do not know when they must stop selling." "There is not enough stock," the source told RFA.North Korea is under heavy international sanctions, which could be lifted if it agrees to complete denuclearization, a step the country has refused to take despite the incentives.Korean Workers' Party newspaper Rodong Sinmun claimed Friday the "price of crude oil is skyrocketing" because of embargoes against Iran. "Because of U.S. sanctions against Iran, it is impossible to predict the direct of oil prices," state media said.Blaming the United States for North Korea policy is a common maneuver, but U.S. President Donald Trump continues to champion his engagement with North Korea.Trump, while campaigning in Columbia, Mo., on Thursday, said his relationship with Kim is "very good.""We are getting to a point where they really want to do something, and we're not going to have to worry about millions of lives being lost," Trump said.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets with top North Korean official Kim Yong Chol next week.
