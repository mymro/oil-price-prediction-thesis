Nov. 20 (UPI) -- Security cameras outside an Oregon store were recording when a man attempting to siphon gas from a U-Haul truck lit his own pants on fire.Portland Fire & Rescue investigators said the U-Haul truck and a van were found engulfed in flames about 7 a.m. Monday and security camera footage from a nearby store recorded a man fleeing the scene with his pants on fire. Investigators said they determined the man had been trying to use tubes to steal gas from the U-Haul truck when the fuel apparently ignited."Something ignited that gasoline caught fire. We don't believe this is what the individual intended," Lt. Rich Chatman of Portland Fire & Rescue told KOIN-TV.
