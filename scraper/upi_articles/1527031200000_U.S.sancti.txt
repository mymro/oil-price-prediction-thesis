May 22 (UPI) -- The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against five Iranian individuals for providing ballistic missile-related technical expertise to Huthi rebels in Yemen.Five individuals linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' al-Ghadir Missile Command, including the missile unit's commander, Mahmud Bagheri Kazemabad have been targeted by the sanctions. The men are accused of transferring "weapons not seen in Yemen prior to the current conflict" on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force."Their actions have enabled the Huthis to launch missiles at Saudi cities and oil infrastructure," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. "They have also disrupted humanitarian aid efforts in Yemen, and threatened freedom of navigation in key regional waterways."Houthi rebels have fired ballistic missiles into the Saudi capital of Riyadh several times over the past few months.Tuesday's sanctions are part of a broader effort by the White House to target Iran's abuse of the Iraqi and Emirati financial systems to support its proxies through the IRGC-QF."The United States will not tolerate Iranian support for Huthi rebels who are attacking our close partner, Saudi Arabia. All countries in the region should be on guard to prevent Iran from sending its personnel, weapons, and funds in support of its proxies in Yemen," Mnuchin said.
