May 15 (UPI) -- Americans shelled out more for things like food and clothing last month in the largest jump in consumer spending this year, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.U.S. retail and food services sales for April rose 0.3 percent from March, officials said in a report Tuesday. April's jump was the second consecutive in 2018, which began continuing a trend of weaker spending at the end of 2017.Officials said gasoline spending increased 0.8 percent from March, likely due to rising prices at the pump.The U.S. average price for a gallon of regular gasoline last month was $2.76 -- the highest since mid-2015.Retail sales were up 4.8 percent from April 2017 and gas sales 11.7 percent.The increase follows strong retail sales in March, which saw an increase of more than a half-percent -- a sign of greater-than-expected consumer confidence.
