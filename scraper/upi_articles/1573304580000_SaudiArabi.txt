Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Saudi Arabia plans to sell up to one-half of 1 percent of its oil company, Aramco, to individual investors, according to a prospectus released Saturday.In what is expected to be the world's largest initial public offering, the kingdom announced last Sunday it will sell the shares on the Saudi Stock Exchange, known as as Tadawul, in December.The value of the company is valued between $2 trillion and $2.3 trillion, CNBC reported, compared with U.S. oil companies' Exxon Mobil with a market cap of nearly $300 billion and Chevron at $229 billion.If 0.5 percent is offered, that equates to $20 billion to $23 billion received in the Public Investment Fund.Saudi Arabia owns about 18 percent of the world's proven petroleum reserves: 260 billion barrels"The price at which all subscribers in the offering will purchase shares, the number of shares to be sold and the percentage of the shares to be sold will be determined at the end of the book-building process," Saudi Aramco said. "The offering is being made available to qualifying individual investors and institutional investors."Saudi-owned news channel Al Arabiya reported that subscription for investors would start Dec. 4 and Saudi Aramco shares would begin to trade on the Tadawul seven days laterJ.P.
