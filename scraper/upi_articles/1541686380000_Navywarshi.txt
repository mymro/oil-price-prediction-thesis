Nov. 8 (UPI) -- Norwegian authorities are investigating a collision Thursday between a navy frigate and an oil tanker that injured several people, officials said.The collision occurred in a western Norway fjord as the KNM Helge Ingstad was returning from NATO exercises, with 137 people aboard. All were evacuated after the warship collided with the Malta-flagged Solar TS tanker, which carried 23 people. The ship was returning to the Haakonsvern Naval Base near Bergen after the military exercises, officials said.The Maltese oil tanker was carrying about 625,000 barrels of crude, but officials said none spilled after Thursday's collision.Authorities said the Norwegian frigate, which carried military weapons, ran aground near Bergen after it started taking on water. It was eventually hauled to a nearby terminal.The navy vessel is one of five Fridtjof Nansen-class Norwegian frigates. Launched in 2007, the warship is named after the famous Norwegian Arctic explorer. It's one of NATO's standing maritime reaction forces."The armed forces are now reviewing all the means available in the region to assist the KNM Helge Ingstad," navy Lt. Col. Ivar Moen said."Norway has a modern and well-trained Navy," Norwegian Cmdr. Preban Ottesen said on the branch's website. "But as a small country ... we depend on our allied partners in NATO, who have the ability and willingness to enforce 'one for all, all for one.'"The cause of the collision is under investigation.
