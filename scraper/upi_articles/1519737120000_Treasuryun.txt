Feb. 27 (UPI) -- The U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control announced sanctions against an oil smuggling network running between Libya and Europe.On Monday, six individuals, 24 entities and seven vessels were sanctioned for threatening security and stability of Libya through the "illicit production, refining, brokering, sale, purchase or export of Libyan oil or for being owned or controlled by designated persons." "Treasury is taking action to expose and end fuel smuggling and other illicit activities by those who are exploiting Libyan oil, petroleum products, and other natural resources for their own personal gain," Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said in a press release."We are disrupting this illicit and destabilizing activity by isolating the individuals, companies, and vessels engaged in oil smuggling from the global financial system." Oil smuggling undermines Libya's sovereignty, the Treasury said, by fueling the country's black market and adding to the instability of the region.Illicit smuggling of Libyan oil is also condemned by United Nations Security Council Resolutions.The OFAC sanctioned Darren Debono, Gordon Debono, Rodrick Grech, Fahmi Ben Khalifa, Ahmed Ibrahim Hassan Ahmed Arafa and Terence Micallef for their involvement in the smuggling of Libyan oil to Europe. Twenty-one companies owned or controlled by Darren and Gordon Debono were also sanctioned along with three additional companies.The vessels sanctioned include the Theodoros as a blocked property of ADJ Trading Limited, the vessels Progres, Zeus and Bonu 5 as blocked properties of Andrea Martina Limited and the vessels Marie De Lourdes, Marie De Lourdes I and Marie De Lourdes V as blocked properties of World Water Fisheries Limited.
