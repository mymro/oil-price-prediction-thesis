May 31 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Commerce said Thursday consumer spending increased by 0.6 percent in April, marking the second straight month of spending growth.The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said spending increased $79.8 billion while personal income increased $49.5 billion. The increase in personal income in April primarily reflected increases in wages and salaries, the bureau said. April's increase in consumer spending was the largest since a 0.7 percent rise in November.Among goods, the bureau said spending for gasoline and other energy products was a leading contributor to the increase. Officials said the increase in gasoline spending from March was likely due to rising prices at the pump. The U.S. average price for a gallon of regular gasoline last month was $2.76 -- the highest since mid-2015.Among services, the largest contributor to the increase was spending for household utilities.U.S. consumers paid more for utilities during an unusually cool month, MarketWatch reported.In March, retail sales were up following three consecutive months of decline.
