In keeping with what has become an annual tradition, we took out our handy crystal ball - manufactured from petroleum-based materials, of course - for a look at expectations for the year to come in 2020. What the crystal ball revealed is a mix of projected outcomes, some of which were entirely predictable, others not so much. Here we go: When President Donald Trump recently announced that he will soon withdraw another 4,000 U.S. military personnel from the 18-year-long quagmire in Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the withdrawal can and will take place “with or without” a peace agreement in place with the Taliban. "I would like to go to a lower number because I want to either bring those troops home" to retrain for new missions or to "be redeployed to the Indo-Pacific to face off our greatest challenge in terms of the great power competition - that's vis-a-vis China", he said. This shift in America’s compelling national interest in remaining involved in various intractable conflicts in the Middle East region is the direct result of the country’s enhanced energy security brought about by the industry’s ability to extract massive volumes of oil and natural gas from shale. That ability was made possible by the use of hydraulic fracturing, or Fracking. Fracking says, “you’re welcome, America!”
