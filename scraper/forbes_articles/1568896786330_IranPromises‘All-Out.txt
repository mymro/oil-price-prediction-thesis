Topline: Iran foreign minister Javad Zarif warned Thursday that if the U.S. or Saudi Arabia strikes back over weekend attacks on Saudi oil pipelines, it would be considered an act of “all-out war,” the most threatening language used yet as tensions have escalated in the region. Crucial quote: “I am making a very serious statement that we don’t want to engage in a military confrontation. But we won’t blink to defend our territory,” said Zarif. What to watch for: How Trump responds and whether he will actually carry out any military action against Iran. Although Trump has threatened retaliation before (he tweeted Wednesday the U.S. is “locked and loaded”), his track record is decidedly more dovish, relying instead on ever-escalating sanctions. Key background: A complicated series of incidents unfolded in the Persian Gulf this summer⁠, stemming from Trump imposing sanctions on Iran’s oil exports, severely crippling the country’s economy. In June, two oil tankers were attacked off Iran’s coast. A week later, Iran shot down a U.S. drone for invading its airspace, which the U.S. denied. In July, Iran said it breached the limit of enriched uranium it was allowed to have on hand, as laid out in the 2015 nuclear deal. Also that month: Iran captured foreign oil tankers, and the U.S. claimed it shot down an Iranian drone.
