Topline: The S&P 500 hit a record high and the Dow jumped almost 250 points Thursday in response to potential interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve—yo-yoing after remarks by PresidentTrump that suggested a possible retaliatory strike against Iran for shooting down a U.S. drone.   Thursday’s market volatility came after Trump amped up demands for rate cuts, mostly on Twitter. Trump previously issued repeated threats to fire Powell after the Fed raised interest rates four times in 2018. During a Wednesday press conference, Powell reiterated his commitment to chairing the Fed. “I think the law is clear that I have a four-year term, and I fully intend to serve it,” he said.
