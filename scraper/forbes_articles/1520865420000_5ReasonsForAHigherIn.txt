If inflation reaches 3%, the Federal Reserve may have to accelerate its timetable for raising interest rates. Bond yields will rise to compensate investors for the loss in purchasing power. Mortgage rates will tick higher. The present discounted value of all dividend and corporate earnings will be trimmed, and the stock market – to the degree that it is partly rational – will experience some level of correction. So with all this in mind, what could possibly lead inflation to 3%? Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index has been lying dormant for the past five years, averaging only 1.3% per annum. Modest price pressure arose last year, however, and the most recent CPI inflation in February advanced by 2.1%. Here are five major reasons on why inflation will go up: Many other factors can move inflation one way or the other. For example, trade restrictions may mean higher prices for toys and shoes. Plenty of rain and good harvests can keep food prices manageable, while a drought can do the reverse. Distribution efficiencies by online retailers like Amazon could hold prices down. A shortage of truck drivers could boost the cost of transportation. More people seeking work after having been out of the labor force will boost labor supply and hold wages from accelerating too fast. Still, the five reasons stated above are too powerful to ignore, and hence inflation will be rising. An inflation rate of 3% by the end of the year is a distinct possibility.
