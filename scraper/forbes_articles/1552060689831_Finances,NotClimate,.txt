Norway has decided to have its sovereign wealth fund divest from all upstream oil and gas holdings. The Norwegian Central Bank, which manages the $1 trillion fund, recommended this move back in November 2017, but the official decision was made this morning, Friday, March 8, 2019. The move comes at a time when oil and gas companies are increasingly under fire for their purported roles in perpetuating climate change. Norway's move to divest from certain oil and gas holdings, however, is not a reflection or a reaction to the environmental movement or to climate change issues. Norway is a major oil and gas producer itself and most of the money in its sovereign wealth fund comes from the profits it derives from energy production. The decision is based on the fear that Norway's sovereign wealth fund is overexposed to risk from price volatility in oil and gas. According to Norwegian politicians, the massive drop in oil prices in 2016 and subsequent price swings suffered by the commodity revealed vulnerabilities and risks present in the sovereign wealth fund's investment mix and prompted the move. Norway's sovereign wealth fund holds $37 billion in energy equities—pnly about 6% of its $1 trillion fund—and the divestment will only impact companies engaged in upstream oil and gas development. Oil majors like Total SA, BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell will not be affected because they do significant business in oil refining and transportation, not just exploration and production. The divestment from companies like U.S. fracking company Anadarko Petroleum Corp and UK producer Tullow Oil PLC will occur gradually.
