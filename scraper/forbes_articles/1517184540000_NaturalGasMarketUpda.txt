Prices The roller coaster ride continues for natural gas in the winter. Prompt month gas prices have been increasing rapidly, up 21% to $3.51 since January 10. February contract expires Monday, and is sure to be much higher than the $2.75 expiration for January (far below the $3.93 for January 2017). Weather Obviously Polar Vortex 2.0 a few weeks ago has made it a very cold January, about 6% colder than normal and 40% colder than last year. January 1 was actually the coldest day of the century thus far, and heating demand reached a record of 77 Bcf/d. Although weather models are somewhat bearish in the near term, they are showing a polar vortex developing around February 5. Forecasters are eyeing another blast of extremely cold air for "Super Bowl weekend," pushing the February contract higher.    Storage We had a very bullish 288 Bcf withdrawal reported on Thursday, which tied January 10, 2014 as the second highest withdrawal on record. It is interesting to note, however, that prices still actually dropped 6 cents on Thursday to settle at $3.45. The highest withdrawal ever, of course, was the 359 Bcf pull reported for the week ending January 5. The storage deficit is starting to grow again, and we are now 18% below the five-year average, when we were just 1-2% below a month or so ago. A surplus of 400 Bcf to the five-year average back in March has turned into a deficit of 486 Bcf today. Falling storage is a growing concern as to where we will be going into the injection season that starts in April. I've seen estimates as low as 1,200 Bcf, compared to 2,055 Bcf last year. Overall, prompt prices rising much faster than deferred contracts signals an undersupplied market that is trying to conserve remaining stocks. Demand Gas demand in the past few days has been normal at ~94 Bcf/d, and this could rise to 102 Bcf/d over the next week or two. But, that expectation changes if another polar vortex arises in early-February. From a broader perspective, gas is expected to remain our main source of electricity both this year and next, respectively generating 33% and 34% of total power. There are some 20,000 MW of new gas capacity coming online this year alone. Remember: power is first and accounts for 34% of all U.S. gas usage. Gas exports, which are the largest source of new demand for us, will see a slight uptick this year. LNG exports will average 3.0 Bcf/d in 2018, up from 1.9 Bcf/d in 2017. Natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico were up about 0.4 Bcf/d to 3.9 Bcf/d in 2017 compared to 2016. This year, they will reach 4.8 Bcf/d, as pipeline constraints in our southern neighbor continue to be alleviated. LNG exports from Dominion's 0.8 Bcf/d Cove Point terminal on Chesapeake Bay has been delayed until March, which will give us our second LNG export facility, after the 3.3 Bcf/d capacity Sabine Pass in Louisiana. We will be the largest LNG exporter by the mid-2020s, up from literally nothing in 2016. Production After falling 8% or so during Polar Vortex 2.0, the good news is that U.S. gas production is back to the record highs we saw in December, at over 77 Bcf/d. This year, average U.S. gas production will jump to over 80 Bcf/d, more than 6 Bcf/d from 2017 and the largest yearly gain in history. In 2019, U.S. output will surge past 83 Bcf/d, helped along by a massive infrastructure buildout that commits producers to more output. Indeed, the U.S. oil and gas sector is set for monstrous growth. Oil prices are at three-year highs, and surging output in the Permian basin in west Texas will grow associated gas production. The Permian is now producing nearly 10 Bcf/d, compared to just 6 Bcf/d two years ago. Already around 90% subscribed, Kinder Morgan leads a nearly 2 Bcf/d, $1.7-billion gas pipeline coming in the Permian thatâ€™ll ease some of the takeaway bottlenecks. U.S. production is clearly the lid on the U.S. gas market, and perhaps even the global oil market. Nearly 70% of oil and gas companies expect to increase capital spending this year. The tidal wave of natural gas is coming: up a whopping 14 Bcf/d since 2012, Appalachia will produce nearly 27 Bcf/d in February and boom to 45 Bcf/d by 2027.
