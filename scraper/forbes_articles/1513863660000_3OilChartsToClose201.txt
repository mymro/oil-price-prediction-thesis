As we begin to close out 2017, oil (and taxes of course) is on everybody's mind. And why not: oil is the world's most vital source of energy, the most traded commodity, and prices have finally started to rise. Over the past month, however, WTI has mostly been stuck in the $56-58 per barrel range, with Brent stuck at $61-64, but still higher than where we were before. The November 30th agreement between OPEC and partners to extend their 1.8 million b/d production cut deal from March 2018 until the end of 2018 is meant to bring global stocks down to the five-year average and erase the glut built-up when oil was above $100. Our continually improving shale business is the lid on oil (and natural gas) prices. U.S. crude production has been surging to highs not seen since the early-1970s. Many U.S. producers can be in the black with prices much lower than they are now, some as low as $30-35. In fact, the U.S. Energy Information Administration just upped its production forecast for 2018 to over 10 million b/d, here. This would be 8-9% above this year and the highest level ever recorded. "Wall Street Returns To U.S. Shale With A Bang." I know that we keep hearing about the electric car revolution that has seemingly been "right around the corner" forever, but the reality is that U.S. oil demand continues to be exceptionally high. Although trapped in the 19-21 million b/d range for over a decade, oil substitutes are few and far between. In fact, U.S. gasoline demand hit a record in August, rising to 9.8 million b/d, here. U.S. gasoline consumption actually accounts for 10% of all global oil consumption, and our usage has risen every year since 2012, hitting a record last year. "Three Reasons Oil Will Continue to Run the World." The good news for oil bulls, is that although still at historically high levels here, U.S. crude stocks continue to drop, reducing a global overhang. The International Energy Agency reports that OECD commercial stocks fell by 40.3 million barrels in October to 2,940 million barrels, the lowest since July 2015 and just 111 million barrels above the five-year average, which is the goal to reach for the OPEC agreement. IEA now says that an expected 0.200 million b/d global oil surplus in the first half of 2018 could easily switch to a 0.200 million b/d deficit in the second half. Rising demand is also offering up more confidence: OPEC now believes it alone needs an $11 trillion investment to meet non-stop growth in consumption, here. Leading incremental market China has already reached 12.5 million b/d, or where it was supposed to be in 2020 per forecasts made last year. Money managers have been increasing their bullish bets on Brent to record highs, while net longs for WTI are close to 9 month highs. Yet, surveys see Brent still to average $60 in 2018, with WTI seen at about $55, here.
