 The approaching 2019 will be the most significant year ever for the U.S. liquefied natural gas export business Next year really is: "the beginning of the boom." The U.S. is poised to triple export capacity to around 10 Bcf/d by the end of next year, and we could be on our way to be the world's largest exporter before 2025. And in a "second wave" of activity, federal regulators will decide the fate of an additional 13 pending projects by the end of 2019. For an industry that just started in February 2016, U.S. LNG has quickly been extending to all corners of the globe. Yet, neighbor and friend Mexico has received 20% of all U.S. LNG exports, with South Korea second at 19%. At some point though, Mexico's primary position will slide because the country wants to produce more of its own gas and build more pipelines to gain greater access to cheaper U.S. piped gas. For example, piped U.S. supply to Mexico has averaged $3.18 per MMBtu so far this year, compared to $4.59 for U.S. LNG to Mexico. In Europe, for instance, the goal is for U.S. LNG to buffer Russian piped gas, upgrading Europe's energy security with more energy supply diversity. Russia admits there is room for the U.S.: Russia’s Gazprom energy giant does not seek to cover all Europe’s gas needs. Earlier this month, Polish state-run PGNiG signed a long-term deal with Cheniere for LNG supplies from the U.S. Russia supplies more than half of Poland's gas demand but long-term contracts are expiring 2022. Critically, PGNiG reports that the price Poland pays for U.S. gas is 20-30% lower than for Russian supply, a global game-changer if such a competitive advantage can be maintained. Germany too is looking to build its first LNG import facility to potentially access more U.S. gas. Playing both sides, Germany has been working with Russia to construct the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline earlier this year while also pledging to support for domestic LNG import facilities.
