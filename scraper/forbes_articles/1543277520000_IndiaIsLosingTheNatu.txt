Coal as the primary fuel in both China and India is a reality that will not change anytime soon. But these giants have committed to using more natural gas, a cleaner fuel that is quickly becoming the world's go-to source of energy thanks to its positive environmental attributes. Gas today is just 6-8% of China's and India's energy usage, compared to nearly 30% in the developed countries. India's switch to using more gas to reduce an over reliance on coal has been much slower than China's. Over the past decade, for instance, India's gas demand has been rising at less than 5%, well below China's growth of 15%. Immense India is the most energy-deprived nation on Earth. The need for all energy will be central to economic goals to lift hundreds of millions of Indians out of poverty. For example, some 300 million Indians have no electricity, with hundreds of millions more lacking adequate access. The average Indian uses just 1/20 of the electricity that the average American does. Having some 400 million kids under the age of 15, India will become the world's most populated country before 2025. The future for gas in India is therefore very bright: PM Modi says that India has a plan to â€œincrease the use of natural gas by 2.5 times by the end of next decade." The main consuming sectors are electricity, city gas distribution, refineries, and petrochemicals. Although India wants to double gas production over the next four years, the import percentage of all domestic gas usage (today at 50%) should be expected to increase. Overall, tightly regulated gas prices have discouraged private sector interest in upstream gas production, particularly more costly offshore where huge deposits sit. For demand to significantly increase, gas must be reliable and affordable. Low cost energy solutions are especially important for poorer countries like India where residents have just 10% of the incomes that we rich, energy-fulfilled Westerners do.
