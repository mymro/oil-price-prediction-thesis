Falling oil prices means Russia will have a fiscal account deficit this year, and one greater than president Vladimir Putin predicted earlier in the month. Putin signed amendments to the 2012 budget only a couple of weeks ago, considerably increasing the projected oil price for 2012 even when oil prices were in decline with no end in sight except for the geopolitical risks in Iran. With his bullish oil forecast, Putin narrowed the budget deficit from 876.589 billion rubles ($27 billion) or 1.5 percent of GDP to only 68.144 billion rubles ($2 billion) or 0.1 percent of GDP. But Russia's sober Finance Minister, Anton Siluanov, said Saturday that the deficit will be much greater than Putin's forecast. "The deficit is likely to be higher than 0.1 percent of GDP. It is likely to be about 1.5 percent of GDP as it was at the initial terms of the budget," Siluanov Ria Novosti newswire reported. Russia is one of the world's largest energy producers. It is the world's largest natural gas exporter and the leading oil exporter to Europe. But falling European demand means falling Brent oil prices, which in turn means cheap Russian-based Urals Mountain oil prices that already trade at a discount to Brent. That means less oil revenue for Russia's highly taxed energy companies, namely Gazprom and Rosneft.
