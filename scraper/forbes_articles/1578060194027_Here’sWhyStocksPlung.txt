(Updated: 11:00 a.m. EST, January 3, 2020) Topline: Global stock markets pulled back from their strong start to the new year and oil prices surged on Friday, following an overnight U.S. air strike that killed Iran’s most senior general and significantly inflamed tensions in the Middle East.   Crucial quote: While the markets’ usual knee-jerk reactions to geopolitical shocks tend to fade, “this particular development is different than the others,” Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note on Friday. Striking Soleimani is the “most consequential decision made by Trump thus far,” while the S&P 500’s high valuation multiple “doesn’t leave it with much capacity to absorb bad news.” Key background: President Donald Trump ordered the strike that killed Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards’ foreign wing—designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. government, late on Thursday. This latest action by the Pentagon comes as a response to a New Year’s Eve attack by Iran-backed militias on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Iran harshly condemned the air strikes and vowed to retaliate: Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter that the U.S. “bears responsibility” for what he called an “extremely dangerous and foolish escalation.” Amid the promises of Iranian retaliation, the U.S. embassy issued a security alert on Friday urging all American citizens to “depart Iraq immediately.”
