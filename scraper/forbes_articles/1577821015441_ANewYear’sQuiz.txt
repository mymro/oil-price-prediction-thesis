You’d think that the last presidential election would have been a dagger to the heart of the prediction business, but guess again: the new year is about to kick off with all sorts of wild stabs as to what will happen during the dawn of a new decade. In this space, we try to be different – and let you do the forecasting. Actually, it’s a concept that dates back to the late, great William Safire, who treated his readers to an annual new year’s quiz. Mr. Safire was indeed a gem, as his surname suggests, as a political columnist and a language expert nonpareil. To honor his memory, here’s my shot at matters to ponder in what should be a raucous 2020. On with the quiz . . . 1) Wall Street enters 2020 on a roll – major indexes hitting record highs in 2019 and the S&P up nearly 30% for the year. In 2020, the DJIA will: (a) continue the “bull” run that takes it well into the 30,000’s; (b) see earnings continue to grow, but at a more moderate pace; (c) finish in the red, for the year; (d) tumble 20% or more based on a cooling economy and uncertainty in Washington and overseas. 2) The economic stat to watch closely in 2020: (a) U.S. GDP growth (expected to fall from 2.3% to 2% or lower); (b) unemployment (excepted to average around 3.5%); (c) interest rates holding steady, absent a shift in Fed policy; (d) consumer confidence, which registered at 126.5 in December vs. 125.5 in November and 134.2 in August; (e) housing starts, which rose 3.2% in late 2019. 3) 2020’s most significant global economics news: (a) the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute; (b) the European Union’s willingness/hesitance to sign off on Brexit’s “Withdrawal Agreement” by year’s end; (c) a politically unsettled Germany entering a recession it avoided in 2019; (d) debt-ridden South Africa downgraded to “junk” status. 4) The most compelling foreign policy story in the new year: (a) Kim Jong Un’s “new path” leads to renewed ICBM testing/U.S. reprisals; (b) police and pro-democracy protestors clashing in Hong Kong; (c) a possible end to the Maduro’s rule in Venezuela; (d) a possible U.S.-Taliban peace agreement in Afghanistan; (e) attacks on Saudi oil production/Persian Gulf tanker traffic affecting world oil prices. 5) 2020’s Democratic presidential nominee will be: (a) former Vice President Joseph Biden; (b) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; (c) Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; (d) South Mayor Pete Buttigieg; (e) former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; (f) Hillary Clinton; (g) none of the aforementioned. 6) The other half of the Democratic ticket: (a) Buttigieg; (b) California Sen.
