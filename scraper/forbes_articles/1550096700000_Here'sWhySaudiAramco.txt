Saudi Aramco is now planning to explore oil and gas resources outside of the Saudi Arabian kingdom. This is according to a recent interview given by the oil minister, Khalid al Falih, to Financial Times. Falih said that, “Going forward the world is going to be Saudi Aramco’s playground,” referring to the national oil company of Saudi Arabia. Al Falih was the CEO of Aramco from 2009 to 2015. This path marks a shift from Aramco’s previous upstream strategy. The highly profitable company has been expanding and diversifying for about 30 years, but it has never before sought to exploit natural resources outside of Saudi Arabia . In fact, when I last asked Aramco executives whether they had any such plans just over a year ago, they denied that they did. In fact, they seemed rather surprised at the idea that they might pursue upstream oil investment outside of Saudi Arabia. It might seem counterintuitive to some for Aramco to produce oil outside of its home country. After all, Aramco has exclusive rights to Saudi Arabia’s reportedly huge oil reserves—268.5 billion barrels of oil in the ground—and the geological properties of the Saudi reserves allow Aramco to produce at between $2 and $10 per barrel. This is the cheapest cost of production in the world. Aramco also enjoys relatively few regulatory constraints compared to what it would face abroad. So why would Aramco even be interested in producing outside of the kingdom? Aramco is also planning an international upstream expansion because it believes there is a future in oil. For all those who believe that peak demand is near because of electric vehicles and alternative energies, Saudi Aramco disagrees. The company sees a profitable future in oil, and Aramco is willing to bet on it.
