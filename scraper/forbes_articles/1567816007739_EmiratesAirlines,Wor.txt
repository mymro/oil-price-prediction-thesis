The Airbus A380 hasn’t even been in service for 12 years, but even its biggest advocate, Emirates Airlines, is already preparing for its demise. Et tu, Brute? The Latin sentence from Shakespeare’s play JULIUS CAESAR, refers to Caesar recognizing his close friend Brutus among his assassins. The idea of the “unkindest cut” being delivered by a friend seems to apply to Emirates’ retirement plans for the Airbus A380, particularly as Emirates President Tim Clark was one of the aircraft’s greatest advocates. Although Emirates says it will fly the A380 through 2035, a pair of A380s have already been removed from Emirates service. Instead of being sold into a used market for the A380,which has never developed, they will be cannibalized to provide spare parts for the remaining fleet, Clark recently told FlightGlobal. “We are in the process of [starting A380 retirements]. Two have been deactivated,” Clark said in the FlightGlobal interview. “They are under retirement because we’ve got a major overhaul coming up and it’s best to take the old aircraft out – they’re all written down – and take the gear off them rather than buy a $25 million main landing gear.” This may be both an economic and practical measure, as the A380 production line is set to close in 2021. Emirates Airlines is by far the world’s largest A380 operator. The airline currently has 112 of the 500-plus-seat (depending on configuration) behemoths in its fleet. Emirates has ordered 123 of the aircraft, almost half of the 250 that Airbus will deliver before the program shuts down. It has been often argued that Emirates is the only airline to profitably operate the plane. Certainly the role of the A380 in building traffic at bustling Dubai International (DXB), the world leader in international travelers with 88 million, is undeniable. As recently as January of this year, Simple Flying ran a story titled “How Are Emirates’ A380s So Profitable?” As Emirates’ A380s have flown over 105 million passengers since 2008, the website said, “Overall, it appears that Emirates’ A380s are profitable because they are a great fit for the airline’s business model of moving large numbers of passengers on its long-haul flights.” The story noted, “There have been allegations that Emirates is able to keep its operating costs low because it receives fuel subsidies from the Government of Dubai. However, these allegations have never been confirmed, and the airline has denied them vehemently.” Nonetheless, over the past year, cracks have begun to appear in the picture of Emirates as a profitable operator of A380 aircraft. Overall, the airline’s profits are way down, according to the Motley Fool. In fiscal 2019, Emirates' airline subsidiary earned $237 million on $26.7 billion of revenue, making its profit margin just 0.9%. Three years earlier, Emirates earned $1.9 billion and had an 8.4% profit margin. Interesting, The Fool points to fuel costs as a key culprit, noting that over those three years, oil prices rose from their 2016 lows, increasing Emirates’ fuel costs by 56%. Fuel now accounts for 32% of Emirates' operating costs and is the largest expense item. Yet een today, Airbus claims “The A380 is the most environmentally-friendly widebody aircraft in the world. With 40 percent more capacity than its nearest competitor and low emission engines, the A380 burns 17 per cent less fuel per seat – translating to 17 percent fewer CO2 emissions. “ However, in the real world, 500-seat A380 aircraft are hard to fill with paying passengers and rarely fly full. Full or empty, the four engines of the hefty plane are thirsty, making fuel costs a key reason the A380 is among the world’s most expensive airliners to operate. Even the type’s most successful operator, Emirates , may be having something of an over-capacity crisis. In 2018, world air traffic grew 7.4%, with another 5% growth estimated for 2019 despite the grounding of 400 737 MAX aircraft. Even during this period of growth, in fiscal 2019, Emirates' load factor, or the percentage of seats filled with paying passengers, actually fell to 76.8% from 77.5% a year earlier. By comparison, the worldwide average load factor rose to 82.1% by 2019. The industry champion at cramming in passengers, Ryanair, achieved an unbelievable 97% load factor in July 2019. With an A380 with approximately 500 seats, Emirates’ anemic 76.8% load factor means that a flight would depart with about 380 passengers and 120 empty seats. Depending on configuration, the more efficient Boeing 777 also operated by Emirates can hold from 350 to 440 passengers, potentially eliminating some empty seats. The math may also play into Emirates decision not to install new first-class suites into the A380. Load factor may also improve when Emirates does introduce increasingly-popular premium economy seating in the A380 next fall. Most Emirates A380 aircraft are leased. Emirates President Clark seems less than sentimental about their fate when they are ultimately returned. “Clearly, the demand in the secondhand market isn’t there,” he told FlightGlobal. “So when we’ve got the life out of the aircraft that we had planned, we’re indifferent to what happens to them in the sense that we don’t have any value left in them and we don’t have to take any write-downs.”
