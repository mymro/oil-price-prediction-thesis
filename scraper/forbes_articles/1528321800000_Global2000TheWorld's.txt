For the past few months, the world has watched as trade tensions escalate between the U.S. and China. The vast economic power the two countries hold is mirrored in the Forbes 2018 Global 2000 list. For the first time since 2015, China and the U.S. split the top 10 evenly this year. China is home to 291 Global 2000 companies while the U.S. is on top with 560. Our 16th annual Global 2000 list includes publicly-traded companies from 60 countries. Collectively, the companies on this list account for $39.1 trillion in sales, $3.2 trillion in profit, $189 trillion in assets and $56.8 trillion in market value. All metrics are up double-digits year-over-year, with profits up an impressive 28%. See the full list here. The Global 2000 ranking is based on a composite score from equally-weighted measures of revenue, profits, assets and market value. Here’s how we crunched the numbers. For the sixth consecutive year, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the China Construction Bank take the number one and two spots. Following closely behind is the United States’ JP Morgan Chase and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which took third and fourth place respectively. Rounding out the top 10 are Agricultural Bank of China (#5), Bank of America (#6), Wells Fargo (#7), Apple (#8), Bank of China (#9) and Ping An Insurance (#10). But the U.S. still dominates in terms of the amount of companies on the overall list, boasting almost 30% of the total. China and Hong Kong’s 291 companies are up from 262 in 2017. On the inaugural list in 2003, there were just 43 companies from China-Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Japan, the United Kingdom and South Korea also broke into the top five countries with the most companies. New this year is Spotify, with arguably the most high-profile IPO on this list. The music-streaming service debuted at #1,644 with a market cap of $27 billion. However, the company saw a profit loss of about $1.3 billion in the past year. In total, the list saw 131 newcomers, with the global IPO market putting 14 companies on the 2018 list. Swedish personal care company Essity was the highest debut in 2018 at #722. Oil and gas companies made a rebound this year, helped in large part by an increase in oil prices. One of the biggest movers on this year’s list is Chevron, which jumped up 338 spots to take #21. The company ended 2016 $497 million in the red, but recently saw profits of $10.2 billion. Former CEO John Watson attributed the 2016 loss to low commodity prices in a letter to stockholders. BP also followed Chevron’s lead, jumping up 323 spots to #36 with a profit of $4.3 billion. Notable drop-offs from the list include Whole Foods, which was acquired by #53 Amazon last year. For the past year, Amazon saw $193.1 billion in sales and a market cap of $777.7 billion. On the mergers and acquisitions front, DowDuPont made its inaugural appearance at #122 after the merger of Dow Chemical and DuPont in September 2017. Last month, the company took the 26th spot on our list of America’s Largest Public Companies, with profits of $1.6 billion. Also new to the list is Canadian fertilizer company Nutrien (#884), which formed when Agrium and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan merged in January.
