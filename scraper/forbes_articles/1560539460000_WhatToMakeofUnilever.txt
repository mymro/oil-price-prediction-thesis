Unilever (NYSE:UL) has signed an agreement to acquire a Japanese-inspired skincare company, Tatcha, for an undisclosed sum. This move furthers Unilever’s bid to strengthen its presence in the premium personal care segment, as it moves away from its stagnating foods business. Tatcha has a growing presence in North America in the natural personal care segment. This acquisition is a small but positive step toward the consolidation of Unilever’s position in the global personal care market. Trefis maintains a long-term price estimate for Unilever at $57, which is around 10% below the current market price.
