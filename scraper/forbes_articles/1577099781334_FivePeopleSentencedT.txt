Topline: Five people have been sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was brutally murdered inside the kingdom’s consulate in Turkey in October 2018. Key background: Khashoggi, once a royal family insider, was an outspoken critic of the Saudi regime and expressed his views in his column for the Washington Post. He became a U.S. resident after relocating there from Saudi Arabia around 10 months before his murder. The writer was reportedly drugged and dismembered, and his remains have not been found. His killing sparked a diplomatic crisis for Saudi Arabia and its leadership as world and business leaders sought to distance themselves from the regime. Eighteen people were subsequently arrested, and 11 were out on trial at the start of the year. In the wake of Khashoggi’s death, President Donald Trump went against the tide of international opinion and has referenced MBS’ denial of any knowledge of Khashoggi’s killing. He also indicated that he was committed to maintaining the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia. Tangent: The sentencing comes amid a storm of criticism directed at various influencers, models and celebrities who were flown out to Saudi Arabia for MDLBeast music festival. Critics, including human rights lawyers and journalists, criticized their posts and attendance and accused Saudi authorities of trying to whitewash the regime and its human rights restrictions as well as Khashoggi’s death.
