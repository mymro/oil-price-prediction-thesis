PABLO PICASSO- Vase Deux Anses Hautes Estimated to fetch $25,000-35,000 in a November Christie’s online-only sale, this ceramic ultimately sold for $68,750. As 400 of these particular vases were produced, that currently values the entire edition at $27.5 million. Long past are the days when purely online sales were disdained by the art trade. Granted, you are still not going to find Picasso oils marketed in such a fashion, but collectors seem to have no problem paying $100,000 or more for sight-unseen works of art. Scrolling back through earlier sales of Vase Deux Anses Hautes, I stumbled upon one which fetched only $9,754 about a decade ago at Lempertz in Cologne. I thought that the story here would be about how much profit you could have made by buying at that price then and selling at $68,750 today. Yet, when I pulled up the original 2008 catalogue description, there at the bottom was the phrase, as translated from the German, “with... breaks in the handles.” Moral: Always check condition reports. ______________________________________________________ JOAN MIRÓ- La Femme Toupie This Joan Miro print appeared in the recent Sotheby’s, NY Important Prints and Multiples Day Sale. For many years, the major houses stuffed all of the prints on offer in a season into a single marathon of an auction. Back in the early 1980’s, you might have had to sit through 700 lots before the sale concluded. These days, the top auctioneers market the prints like the paintings, splitting the sale into two parts. First, they hold an exclusive evening sale spotlighting the top few works, at which private collectors in sky boxes try to outbid each other for the headline lots. They then drop the rest of the pieces into the “Day Sale” the next morning, where dealers can frequently be found sloughing off the items they have not been able to sell privately. This example of La Femme Toupie went unsold with an estimate of $35,000-45,000 on October 26th. The story here is how much the market for this type of work has yet to recover from the 1989/1990 Japanese-buyer-fueled bubble. In May of 1989, this would have cost you almost $70,000. Had you been the one who had paid that price back then and then held onto the work until today, you would have lost a small fortune. Moral: Art does not always appreciate. ______________________________________________________ ÉDOUARD MANET- Vaches au Pâturage A private collector bought this oil at an auction in November of 2008 for $86,500, just as the Financial Crisis was deflating the art market. It had been expected to bring $80,000-120,000, so that looked to be a pretty solid purchase. (A quick note here on Buyer’s Premium: the “hammer price” in the room was $70,000, and then the auction house tacked on its fee to the buyer of $16,500. Announced post-sale prices invariably include the Buyer’s Premium, whereas the numbers in the pre-sale estimate do not. Hence, that buyer paid a below-estimate $70,000, not a mid-estimate $86,500.) Now, back to the subject work. The collector who paid $86,500 tried to make a quick profit five years later, when he/she consigned it to Christie’s, where it was assigned an estimate of $120,000-160,000. Unfortunately, it did not find a buyer, so it went back into the closet for another five years or so. Just two weeks ago, it was offered at the Sotheby’ s, NY Impressionist & Modern Art Day Sale with an estimate of $70,000-90,000, which was even lower than that which it had been assigned way back in 2008. Thus, it was looking as if the collector was about to take a beating. Yet, much to everyone’s surprise, it sold for $237,500. Moral: The art market is notoriously fickle; even the top auction experts cannot reliably predict its swings.
