For the last few months, President Trump and the Republicans have been worried that oil prices would become exceedingly high going into the midterm elections. In June, the American oil benchmark, WTI, hit a three and a half year high, reaching over $74 per barrel. If prices had continued to rise due to the sanctions on Iran, American voters would hold President Trump and the Republicans responsible . The worst part for Republicans was that they had inexplicably set the Iran sanctions to restart on November 4, just two days before the midterm elections. Some analysts predicted that the Iran sanctions could cause the price of the international oil benchmark to soar to $100 per barrel. President Trump was clearly concerned, and he began a public campaign to pressure OPEC and its most powerful member, Saudi Arabia. His goal was to compel them to produce more oil to counteract the expected Iran decreases. He spoke to the Saudi king on the phone, he talked about it at rallies and he sent a series of tweets about it. He wanted Saudi Arabia to produce more oil, and he believed they owed it to the U.S. to act. Now it seems that the president and the Republicans have dodged the political oil bullet. The average price of gasoline is still only about $2.84. This is far enough below the psychological barrier of $3.00 per gallon, that it does not seem likely to cause a problem before election day. There are three reasons oil prices have stayed down and saved the Republicans from a serious political headache.  Perhaps Trump’s persistent pressure on Saudi Arabia to increase oil production has paid off – or perhaps they just got lucky that U.S. voters won’t be looking at $3.00 or $4.00 per gallon gasoline prices as they head to the polls on November 6.
