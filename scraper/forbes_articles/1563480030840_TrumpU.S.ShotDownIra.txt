Topline: President Trump said Thursday the U.S. shot down an Iranian drone over the Strait of Hormuz, following Iran’s morning announcement that it captured an oil tanker nearby and further escalating tensions in the region. Key background: Since the Trump administration withdrew the U.S. in 2018 from an international Obama-era agreement designed to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran, the Mideast country has been involved with or blamed for various incidents in the region. In May and June, two different oil tanker attacks occurred off Iran’s coast. Iran denied involvement, but the U.S. blamed Iran for both incidents. Escalating tensions between the two countries—including Iran downing a U.S. Navy drone—led Iran to end all diplomacy with the United States. Iran also announced this month it exceeded the limit of enriched uranium as stipulated in the nuclear agreement after additional penalties were imposed following the tanker and drone incidents.
