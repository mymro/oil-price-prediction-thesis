Topline: The United States has released images to back its claim that Iran was behind the attack on key Saudi oil facilities over the weekend, not the Houthi rebels in Yemen who claimed the strikes. Oil prices soared after the attacks halved output from the world's second largest oil producing country. Crucial quote: “Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed,” President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday night. Key background: The attacks deep inside Saudi territory threatened not only the kingdom's core industry but also the energy markets with the strikes effectively taking 5% of global oil output offline.
