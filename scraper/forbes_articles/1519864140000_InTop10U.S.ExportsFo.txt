In the last quarter-century, U.S. exports have grown from $448.16 billion to $1.55 trillion. That's a lot of cotton and corn, gold and diamonds, wheat and soybeans. It's quite a few medical devices and medicines, motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts, jets and jet engines. It's a lot of chicken and beef, citrus and almonds, and so much more. In that time, the United States has gone from having 86 export categories valued at more than $1 billion in value to having 248 above $1 billion, the final tally for 2017. We have gone from having six of the roughly 1,265 export categories above $10 billion in 1993 to 22 today. While none topped $100 billion a quarter-century ago, one does today: aircraft and related parts. Imports have also grown rapidly in the time, as well, as has the United States' trade deficit. But the balance of trade — the ratio between exports and imports — is little changed, having gone from 44 cents of every dollar in U.S. trade being an export to 40 cents in 2017.    Most of the growth rests with the top 10 exports, not surprisingly. Here is a closer look at the top 10 U.S. exports in 2017, based on U.S. Census data analyzed by WorldCity, the company where I serve as president. I have done previous columns on the top 10 trade partners and the top 10 airports, seaports and border crossings. One will follow on the top 10 imports. A couple of things are apparent in this look at top 10 exports. First, in attempting to get better trade deals with our top three trade partners, China, Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration will continue to face some pretty fierce and well-financed resistance from companies that depend on them for their exports. Not that that will necessarily deter or otherwise sway the administration. Second, the top 10 is a nice mixture of industrial age and information age exports, the new and the old.
