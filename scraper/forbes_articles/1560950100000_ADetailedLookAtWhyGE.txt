Since the financial crisis, General Electric’s (NYSE:GE) stock price has collapsed – destroying about $200 billion in shareholder wealth. The company’s market cap was almost $300 billion before the downturn but slumped to just $50 billion in early 2009 due to concerns about the quality of assets held by GE Capital at the peak of the recession. The company’s market cap recovered to $250 billion by mid-2015, though, and remained largely around that level till early 2017 before sliding again to settle at its current level of $90 billion. General Electric’s journey over the last decade has been marred by inappropriate acquisitions which adversely affected its revenues and profitability.
