President Trump is continuing to fulfill his promise to upend the world of trade, this week announcing plans for an extensive new set of tariffs against China. Global markets are beginning to take notice. The President and his advisers argue that his aggressive tariffs are still just a temporary means to a better end – a trading system that they view as fair. But given that the President’s trade negotiating style has shown no real signs of success to date, it is natural to ask what happens if trade barriers just beget more trade barriers, rather than delivering a better world. How bad would a trade war be? The distinguished economist Paul Krugman recently penned an excellent intro to the topic. He comes up with a rough estimate that a trade war could cost 2.1 percent of U.S. GDP. As he characterizes it, “That’s not a small number, but it’s not that huge either.” So why do policy-oriented economists seem so dire when they inveigh against this sort of global trade breakdown? Krugman offers one reason why a trade war could feel worse than the modest number indicates – the disruption accompanying new production and trade patterns could force millions of workers to find something different to do for work. Here are six more reasons (somewhat wonky, as Krugman might say) why this sort of conventional analysis may understate the costs of a trade war: There is an old joke about the dismal science: How can you tell economists have a sense of humor? They use decimal points. While it may be reassuring to have a manageably-small estimate of the damage a trade war might do, there is little reason to have confidence in such estimates. While quantification is difficult, there is a reason trade economists strongly warn against blundering into a trade war.
