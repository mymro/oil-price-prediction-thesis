As the calendar changes, the price of West Texas Intermediate oil (WTI) is hovering around $60 per barrel. WTI is the U.S. benchmark oil and the underlying commodity used by the New York Mercantile Exchange in oil futures contracts. It is based on a type of light, sweet oil that was produced primarily in Texas in the first part of the 20th century. After WTI fell at the end of 2014 and ultimately hit prices below $30 less than two years ago, most oil traders and oil producers are thankful for what is seen as a rebound. About a decade ago, though, WTI was trading at $145 per barrel (in July 2008). In inflation-adjusted dollars for November 2017, that $145 would be worth over $160. In other words, WTI is today valued at $100 less than it was valued nine and a half years ago.  At its peak in the summer of 2008, WTI was sitting at an unrealistic price. $145 could not last, and it did not. Less than a year later, amid the chaos of the global financial collapse at the end of 2008, WTI plummeted and briefly dipped below $40 per barrel. Then it quickly shot back up, eventually spending four years (from the end of 2010 to the end of 2014) in a comfortable range of $80 to $110. Then, of course, came the aforementioned price collapse that has been blamed on the fracking revolution, low demand, OPEC decisions and speculators.    In the summer of 2008, the price was high in part because many professionals believed the world was facing “peak oil,” a misguided theory that we had reached the peak of discoveries of new sources of oil. That summer, consumers became used to gasoline at $4.00 per gallon in some cities. Back then, a bet on WTI at $160 per barrel in 2018 would have seemed conservative . Today WTI is $100 below that. Amidst all of the 2018 market predictions it is important to remember that 10 years ago few thought that oil prices would be this low today. The lesson here is that oil prices are fickle and despite the many predictions claiming to pinpoint the price of oil in a year or the average price throughout 2018, no one can forecast the future.
