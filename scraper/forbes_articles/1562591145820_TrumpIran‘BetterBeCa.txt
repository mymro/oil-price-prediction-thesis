Topline: President Trump reacted Sunday to Iran’s second violation in a week of an Obama-era international agreement designed to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon: “It's no good, they better be careful,” he said. Key background: The 2015 agreement, named the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was designed to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and specified a percentage of enriched uranium the country was allowed to keep on hand. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement—originally between Iran and the U.S., the U.K., China, Russia, Germany and France—in 2018 and imposed stiff economic sanctions against Iran instead. The remaining nations were left to obey the sanctions or ease Iran’s economic burden as outlined in the agreement. Iran said it will scale back its JCPOA obligations every 60 days until the European nations uphold their side of the agreement, according to the New York Times.
