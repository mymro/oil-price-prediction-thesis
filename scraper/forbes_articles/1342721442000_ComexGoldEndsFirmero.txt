Comex gold futures prices ended the U.S. day session moderately higher Thursday. The key outside markets were in a bullish posture for the precious metals—weaker U.S. dollar index and higher crude oil prices. Trading in gold and silver remains choppy and sideways on the daily charts. Don’t be surprised to see more of the same for at least the next couple weeks as the dog days of summer approach. August gold last traded up $8.20 at $1,579.00 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted up $6.30 an ounce at $1,580.50. September Comex silver last traded up $0.075 at $27.17 an ounce. Some more weak U.S. economic data released Thursday morning added to the notions the Federal Reserve will soon implement another round of quantitative easing of U.S. monetary policy. That was also a positive for the gold and silver market bulls Thursday. In overnight news, it was generally quiet on the Asian and European economic and financial front. However, tensions in the Middle East are heightened following a suicide bomber attack on a bus in Bulgaria, which carried Israeli tourists. Israel blamed Iran for the attack and said it would respond with force. Also late Wednesday a suicide bomber attacked Syrian leader Assad’s national security headquarters and killed the defense minister and Assad’s brother-in-law. Any military conflict in the Middle East would likely prompt fresh safe-haven investment demand for gold. Also, crude oil would likely rally sharply, which would also help to boost the gold market. The U.S. dollar index was weaker and hit a fresh two-week low Thursday. Profit taking was featured but the greenback bulls are fading a bit. Meantime, Nymex crude oil futures prices were solidly higher Thursday and hit a fresh nine-week high of $92.94 a barrel. The London P.M. gold fix is $1,584.00 versus the previous London P.M. fixing of $1,575.25. Technically, August gold futures prices closed near mid-range Thursday.
