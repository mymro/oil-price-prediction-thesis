Topline: In the wake of last month’s attack on Saudi Aramco oil facilities, the state oil giant has quickly recovered, aiming to restore full production and forging ahead with its plans for what would be the world’s largest-ever IPO later this year. Key background: The drone attack on Aramco facilities in mid-September effectively knocked out 5% of the world’s oil supply, causing oil prices to surge by as much as 20%—although they have since recovered. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia have blamed Iran for the attacks, a charge which Tehran continues to adamantly deny. What to watch for: The success of the IPO will be closely tied to the price of oil, which is down over the last year despite rising geopolitical tensions in the Gulf.
