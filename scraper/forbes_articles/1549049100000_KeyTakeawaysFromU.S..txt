U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) released its Q4 2018 earnings results on January 30, 2019, followed by a conference call with analysts on January 31, 2019. The company fell short of analysts’ expectations for revenue as well as earnings, primarily due to much lower than expected growth in the European flat-rolled and tubular segment on the back of a decrease in shipments and increased costs per ton. U.S. Steel reported revenue of $3.69 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, which marks a growth of 17.8% on a year-on-year basis. Adjusted net earnings per share saw a sharp increase to $1.82 in Q4 2018, from $0.76 in Q4 2017.

Key Factors Affecting U.S. Steel’s Q4 Results For the full year, US Steel’s revenue increased by 15.7% to $14.2 billion, from $12.3 billion in 2017, benefiting from increased shipments under flat-rolled and tubular segments, partly offset by lower volume in the European operations. The pricing environment was favorable during the year due to robust demand from the end-markets and the imposition of import tariffs in the US. The company’s cost reduction led to a significant increase in the net earnings per share to $5.36 in 2018 from $1.94 in the previous year. What is in store for 2019? Going forward, we expect US Steel to face rising costs and lower shipments in its European segment in 2019. US Tubular and flat-rolled divisions are expected to continue seeing healthy growth on the back of rising volume and favorable pricing environment. The company’s net income margin increased from 3.2% to 7.9% in 2018, benefiting from lower costs and increased productivity from the $2 billion asset revitalization program. Additionally, in December 2018, the company redeemed all of its outstanding Senior Notes due 2020 ($356 million aggregate principal amount). This is expected to be reflected in lower interest expense and finance costs for 2019, thus translating into a high margin of about 8%. We have a $31 price estimate for U.S. Steel’s stock, which is currently higher than its market price. What’s behind Trefis?
