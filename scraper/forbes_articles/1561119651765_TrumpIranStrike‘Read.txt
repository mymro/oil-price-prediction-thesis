Topline: President Trump’s decision to pull out of a strike against Iran was followed with a Friday morning tweet storm, and then an afternoon NBC interview, where he said the strike was “ready to go subject my approval,” but upon learning 150 people would be killed, “didn’t think it was proportionate” to Iran shooting down an unmanned U.S. drone.    Key background: Iran shot down the U.S. drone over the Strait of Hormuz, a transportation route for a good portion of the global oil supply. The strait is near the site of two separate oil tanker attacks that have occurred since May. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, along with Trump, held Iran responsible for both attacks. The U.S. announced Monday it would deploy 1,000 more troops to the Middle East in response to “hostile behavior” by Iran. That same day, Iran announced it would have enough enriched uranium on hand to surpass the level determined in a 2015 agreement, designed to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon, signed by an international consortium, including the U.K. and EU. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement last year, saying it was “defective,” and reimposed sanctions that were lifted while the U.S. remained in the agreement. Those sanctions have placed Iran on the brink of economic collapse.
