Royal Dutch Shell’s (NYSE: RDS.A) Integrated Gas business accounts for 20% of the company’s value, according to our estimates. LNG price movement is closely related to that of crude oil prices. As such, the average price realization for LNG was lower in 2015 and 2016. However, a recovery in oil prices since the second half of 2017 led to better price realization for Shell in the recent quarters, and this has aided the segment growth. We expect a low single digit segment revenue growth in 2018, and beyond, led by an increasing demand for LNG. We have created an interactive dashboard highlighting the company’s Integrated Gas business. You can adjust revenue drivers and margins for 2018 and 2019 to see how it impacts the company’s overall revenues, earnings, and price estimate.
