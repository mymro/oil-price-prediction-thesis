Traders and investors continue to debate whether QE3 will be implemented, and if so when. Thursday’s batch of weak U.S. economic data bolstered the case that a fresh quantitative easing move by the Federal Reserve will occur soon. Attention of the market place has turned to the Middle East late this week, following recent developments in that volatile region. However, it won’t be long until the European Union and its sovereign debt crisis are back on the front burner of the market place.
