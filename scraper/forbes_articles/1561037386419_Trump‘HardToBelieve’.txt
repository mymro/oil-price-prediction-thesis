Topline: Iran admitted to shooting down a U.S. military drone on Thursday—Iran claims it was in Iranian airspace, U.S. officials say it was in international waters—with President Trump calling it a "big mistake", and suggesting the downing was mistakenly authorized by someone "loose and stupid." Key background: The drone downing followed two separate attacks since May on oil tankers near the strait (a known oil transportation route), with the most recent attack last week. The U.S. blamed Iran for both incidents, while Iran denied involvement. Since last week’s attack, the Trump administration announced it will deploy 1,000 additional troops to the Middle East, in response to what the U.S. believed was “hostile behavior” by the Iranians. Mere hours before the U.S. announced the deployment, Iran said it was close to having enough uranium on hand to create a nuclear weapon. That would be a clear violation of the 2015 agreement designed to prevent Iran from having nuclear weapons. The agreement was signed by the P5+1, a consortium of world powers: the U.S., the U.K., France, China, Russia, Germany, plus the European Union, and stipulated that in return for the lifting of economic sanctions by the P5+1, Iran would limit its nuclear activity and allow inspectors to visit its facilities to confirm. Trump imposed sanctions on Iran after pulling the U.S. out of the deal last year (having called the agreement "defective" and "insane") and further tightened those sanctions last month, putting Iran on the brink of economic collapse. The drone: The RQ-4A Global Hawk is a highly advanced and unmanned surveillance drone manufactured by Northrop Grumman. Each drone costs the U.S. government over $220 million to manufacture. The RQ-4A boasts a wingspan of over 130 feet and can reach speeds over 390 miles per hour.
