(Updated: 12:56 PM) Topline: Iran deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi rejected President Trump’s claim that the U.S. downed an unmanned Iranian drone Thursday over the Strait of Hormuz and suggested the U.S. had targeted its own aircraft. Key background: Since the U.S. withdrew from Obama’s Iran deal, tensions have steadily escalated between Iran and the West. In May and June, two different oil tanker attacks occurred off Iran’s coast. Iran denied involvement, but the U.S. blamed the nation for both incidents. When Iran downed a U.S. Navy drone in June, the incident led to Iran severing diplomatic ties with America. Meanwhile, Iran announced this month that it exceeded the limit of enriched uranium in the Obama-era nuclear deal but insisted it would use the material for peaceful purposes only, according to the New York Times.
