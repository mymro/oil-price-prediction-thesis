The Deloitte Football Money League was published on Thursday, January 24 and features three Bundesliga sides, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke. On the very top of the table are Bayern, who are ranked the fourth richest club by revenue in the world. The Bavarian giants announced annual revenue of €629.2m at the end of the 2018 fiscal year. Only Real Madrid (€750.9m), Barcelona (€690.4m) and Manchester United (€666m) rank above Bayern. Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund ranked 12th with annual revenue of €317.2m and Schalke were in 16th spot with yearly revenue of €243.8m. Deloitte did not take into account revenue generated through transfers. Dortmund announced annual revenue of €536m in August 2018. But a large chunk of that revenue was generated by selling top players Ousmane Dembélé (Barcelona) and Pierre-Emerick-Aubameyang (Arsenal). Dortmund was able to generate €222.7m through player transfers. In fact, Deloitte highlights an overall decline of Borussia Dortmund's revenue. Overall, the club has generated €15.4 million (5%) less than the previous year. The primary reason, so Deloitte, was a €10.4m reduction in commercial revenue and lower merchandise sales after failures in domestic and UEFA competitions.
