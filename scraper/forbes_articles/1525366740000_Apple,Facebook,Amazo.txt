Apple shares are bucking the trend of the stock market. The company reported strong earnings this week, hiked its cash dividend by 16% and to ensure bullishness announced another $100 billion buyback of stock. It had repurchased some $23.5 billion of common stock this past quarter, the largest single buyback in corporate history. Exceedingly higher profit margins on its $1,000 phone and surprising growth in the service business makes the Apple phone the most profitable product in the world. And the stock sells at only 16 times earnings. Amazon’s quarterly profit rose mightily to $1.6 billion, including a stellar performance of the company’s cloud computing business known as Amazon Web Services for the second consecutive quarter of a “remarkable acceleration” in growth that the market also celebrated. Revenues jumped 43% while earnings per share soared surprisingly to $3.27 a share. Make no mistake; this was a stupendous performance for one of the premier stock holdings in America. A stunning addition: revenues from Amazon Web Services rose 49% to $5.44 billion from the same period a year ago. All told, a revelation of the dynamism of Amazon’s growth trajectory. Slim pickings in profits are now apparently a theme of the past. Facebook also enjoyed a blowout quarter with net income rising by 63% to $5 billion this year. Facebook has already retraced its price per common share near the $175 marker after the scandal about personal information privacy and troubling congressional hearings. All this despite the realization Facebook will have to spend more money on compliance to protect the personal information of its 2 billion users, which could impact profit margins. Among other tech shares that have led the market, Alphabet (Google) also turned in a favorable report, which kept its shares above $1,000 a share. Meanwhile, the general market is down 10 of the past 12 sessions as investors wonder if the earnings largesse from the giant tax cut has produced big gains as a one-time shot. As well, the two-year Treasury yield has risen to over 2.4% — its highest level since the summer of 2008. I have heard of investors selling stocks and funneling the proceeds into these safe government paper. What’s more, core inflation has moved back above 2% as oil prices have spiked recently to the $70-a-barrel level. We are waiting for the Fed to continue raising rates later this year in what can be termed evidence of quantitative tightening, the opposite of the quantitative easing that helped push equity prices higher some 10 years ago. “When the Fed pushed its balance sheet up, we saw a match between the growth of the Fed’s balance sheet and that of the stock market,”says Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network and a Forbes contributor. “The QT (Quantitative Tightening) program is designed to restore that balance. The question is whether the stock market will then follow the Fed balances down.” I say yes; that is the number one problem for the stock market going forward. Another worrying sign: The yield curve, the difference between the return on the two-year Treasury and the 10-year Treasury has been narrowing to about 50 basis points. Wall Street believes that when the short rate surpasses the 10-year rate, it is an ominous sign that a recession may be in the works down the road. In short, there are several warning signs in the market. A serious foreshadowing was Caterpillar’s warning that its latest quarterly profits gains may well be the peak of the cycle for profits from this established market leader.
