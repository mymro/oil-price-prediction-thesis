BP announced Tuesday, Jan. 21, that CFO Brian Gilvary has decided to retire as of June 30. He will be succeeded on July 1 by Murray Auchincloss, the CFO of BP Upstream, which oversees BP’s oil and gas activities. Auchincloss has served as Upstream CFO since 2015, following two years as deputy CFO. Overall he’s been with the company since he joined BP predecessor Amoco Canada nearly 30 years ago. BP chairman Helge Lund said in a statement that Auchincloss was chosen “after a thorough selection process” and praised his “international financial and commercial experience.” Auchincloss’s annual base salary will be a little more than $900,000 a year. Gilvary will be departing BP after 34 years with the London-based oil and gas giant, the last eight years as CFO. During his time at BP, Gilvary was instrumental in helping the company bounce back from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and the oil price crash of 2014/15, as well as playing a key role in the company’s business dealings with Russia. Lund called Gilvary “one of the architects of today’s BP, key to its transformation into a safer, simpler and stronger company.”
