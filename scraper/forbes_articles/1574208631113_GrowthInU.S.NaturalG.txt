A 60% rise in U.S. natural gas production since 2008 is has been the primary factor keeping domestic gas prices so low. Since the shale boom took flight in 2009, monthly Henry Hub prices have averaged $3.39 per MMBtu, as compared to $5.67 the decade prior. Averaging $3.00 since 2014, natural gas has been stuck in a bearish market for years now. Yet, even with low prices and a gas-directed rig count that has plummeted from 202 to start 2019 to 129 last Friday, output has continued to rise to record highs. Compared to $3.27 per MMBtu last year, Henry Hub gas prices in 2019 have averaged just $2.71, but our gas production this year has been 8-10% higher. Looking forward, more of a maintenance mode approach is expected for 2020: balance sheets and dividends over more and more production. In 2020, CAPEX spending is expected to slow down, especially in Appalachia, which holds the Utica and Marcellus shale plays that account for nearly 40% of all U.S. gas output. Appalachian gas production growth in 2020 is expected to be at 2-3% year-on-year, versus 8-9% growth this year. Just some of the thinking out there. The largest gas producer in the region and country, EQT, expects 2020 to see “roughly flat to 2019 expected sales volumes.” EQT puts 2020 CAPEX to range from $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, a $30% year-over-year reduction compared with prior guidance. CNX Resources has cut expected 2020 CAPEX by 8-10%, with slightly lower production volumes coming as well. Range Resources was more vague in its Q3 Earnings Call but says that for 2020 the “first priority is operating the business with organically generated cash flow,” not production growth. Cabot Oil & Gas puts 2020 production growth at 5%, down from 7% in 2019. For the U.S. gas industry, maintaining financial strength and flexibility is an essential goal to become even stronger and more sustainable. But to be sure, growing less slowly is not the same thing as declining, a fact that regularly gets conflated by those opposing shale. U.S. gas production is still at all-time records. With a constant deployment of more efficient technologies and operations, much of the U.S. gas resource base can be had even with $2.25 gas prices. Further, although spending less, companies could still increase output by tapping their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs), just like we saw in 2016. And hedging output will help: EQT puts plans at 87% of 2020 gas production hedged at a weighted average floor price of $2.71. The U.S. Department of Energy sees domestic production rising another 2.8 Bcf/d next year, even with prices at $2.58. Slower growing 2020 production amid a burgeoning export business especially could lift prices and ultimately expand output even more down the road. Higher crude oil prices could also bring a flood of associated gas in the Permian basin, already yielding almost 20% of domestic gas. More bullish in the longer term, an additional 20-25 Bcf/d at least is widely expected for the country through 2040. This high optimism around U.S. gas output is why NYMEX futures contracts sit below $3.00 per MMBtu for many years to come. The December 2019 contract closed today at $2.51, and December 2025 is just $2.79. Truly remarkable. Americans should realize that our gas market requires a fair price for both producers and consumers. It’s not complicated. Too low prices can push our energy companies beyond the brink to bankruptcy, as we saw in the price collapse of 2014-2017. Especially with gas being locked-in as our go-to fuel to lower CO2 emissions and support intermittent renewables, without new domestic supply we will very easily be forced to expensively import from a precarious global supply chain that Russia’s Gas Exporting Countries Forum seeks to dominate. The anti-shale business should heed the same warning.
