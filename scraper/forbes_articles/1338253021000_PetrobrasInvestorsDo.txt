Brazilian oil company Petrobras (PBR) will not be seeing higher gas prices at the pump anytime soon, the company's CFO said Monday. All year, when prices of crude oil were rising to nearly $120 per barrel, investors lamented the fact that Petrobras was not benefiting from higher prices because the government would not allow for an increase. That's because the government was more concerned about inflation than Petrobras' bottom line. The government owns the company. Brazilians pay nearly $9 per gallon of gasoline, or around R$4 per liter. Now that oil prices are falling, gasoline prices are not expected to be going up anytime soon. "The need for a gas price increase for us has diminished. Our Board of Directors are comfortable with these price levels and it seems like they believe prices will fall further," Almir Barbassa, Petrobras' chief financial officer, told reporters at Reuters Latin America Investment Summit in Rio de Janeiro on Monday.
