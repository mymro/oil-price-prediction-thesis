Topline: Iran announced Monday it exceeded the limit of stockpiled uranium it previously agreed to in a 2015 deal specifically designed to keep Iran from having a nuclear weapon. Key background: Since May, two separate oil tanker attacks and the downing of a U.S. Navy drone, all off the coast of Iran, have escalated tensions between both countries. Trump blamed Iran for the tanker attacks, while Iran denied any involvement. (Iran did take responsibility for the drone downing, claiming the drone violated their airspace.) In retaliation for the drone downing, Trump imposed additional sanctions on Iran, which Iran responded to by declaring dead all diplomacy between the two countries. What to watch for: The stock market’s reaction and Trump’s response. Fears of conflict spiked oil prices, since Iran is near a transportation route for the global oil supply. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell while Trump reacted to the drone downing. The president has yet to tweet or issue a response to the uranium stockpile news, but the past suggests the markets could react negatively.
