On Saturday morning, Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities experienced an attack that resulted in a loss of 5.7 million barrels per day of oil output. Oil production is likely to resume quickly as Aramco is already making repairs. In fact, the company expects to bring 2 million barrels per day of output back online by Monday or Tuesday. President Trump weighed in on this weekend’s attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure on Sunday night. Notably, the President did not mention Iran, although many–including his Secretary of State have blamed that country for the attacks. Instead, President Trump focused on his own agenda–keeping oil prices low and building oil and gas infrastructure in the United States. Authorizing a release from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) should help calm oil markets and gasoline prices, although it is unlikely that there will be any need for the SPR to put additional barrels on the market. Expediting the approval process for pipelines in U.S. oil producing regions won’t improve the situation at hand and it probably wouldn’t make a difference to a similar situation in the future. But Trump clearly saw an opportunity to advocate for an issue of importance to the American economy and took it.
