 Well, it's that time of year when we all gripe about rising gasoline prices. This is a ritual that happens every year, and it is even more pronounced this year due to the fact that the price for regular unleaded gas has moved to its highest level in half a decade. While the initial reaction most of us have when we drive up to the gas pump to see the price of regular has risen by ten cents a gallon since the last time we had to fill the tank is to blame it all on a grand conspiracy to gouge the consumer by the nebulous entity we like to refer to as "Big Oil," the truth is that there is a very well-defined and easily-identified set of market- and regulatory-based factors that directly cause the price increase we see each year. Here are five such reasons: Thus, we can blame the EPA for some portion of the higher gasoline price. On the other hand, this policy has been highly successful in mitigating atmospheric ozone and reducing those ugly inversion layers that used to be a fact of daily life in large metropolitan areas around the country. Cleaning up the air costs money, and we've all been paying a part of doing it. As you can see, there really are very good, easily-explained reasons why gasoline prices tend to rise just about the same time each year we all get ready to start planning summer vacations. As much as we'd like to think otherwise, none of them have anything to do with a grand conspiracy by "Big Oil."
