We have reduced our Trefis price estimate for Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), the largest oilfield services provider, from about $51 per share to around $44 per share. While oil prices have posted some gains this year, the company could see slower revenue growth particularly in North America, where investors have been calling for oil and gas companies (Schlumberger’s customers) to cut back spending after years of strong investments in shale, working within their cash flows in order to boost shareholder returns. Moreover, it’s unlikely that pricing and margins will return to levels seen pre-2014. Below, we take a look at some of the trends driving our price estimate for the company.
