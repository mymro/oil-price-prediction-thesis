The oil decline does not appear to be complete. The oil price has entered the two most bearish months of the year, rising 40.5% of the time in October and 36.1% of the time in November. The histogram below displays the expected return. If oil declines in August as it did, the odds are two in three that there will be no firm low until December or January. This reinforces the falling monthly oil cycle. The current short-term rally is likely to persist into the 11th; the decline is likely to resume on that date. Looking at the daily price histogram for the month in Chart 3, the weakest part of the month commences on the 11th. The next low is likely in the $43-$45 range.
