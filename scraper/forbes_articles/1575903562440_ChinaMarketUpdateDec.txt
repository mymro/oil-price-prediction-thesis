Japan, Mainland China, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, Indonesia and India managed gains while Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand were off.

US imports ticked up slightly as economists speculate that agriculture purchases may have helped while exports to the US ticked down slightly. The US media would have you believe China’s economy is reliant on the US. However, China’s economy is becoming geared to consumption as opposed to manufacturing. Exports to regional countries (ASEAN) accounted for 16.2% of November exports, while the EU accounted for 15.6% versus the US’ 16%. One factor is that Hong Kong accounted for 12% of China’s exports. Exports to Hong Kong are subsequently reshipped. The data was released over the weekend, but didn’t appear to be a major factor in Monday trading.
