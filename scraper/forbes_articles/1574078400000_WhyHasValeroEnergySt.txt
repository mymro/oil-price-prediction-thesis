Valero Energy (NYSE: VLO) has seen its stock price rise by 13% over the last month, following its stronger than expected Q3 results. Revenues came in at $27.25 billion, about $1.3 billion ahead of consensus, while adjusted EPS also beat street estimates, as the company benefited from new projects including an alkylation unit, pipelines, and terminals project. Operating cash flows also saw a meaningful year-over-year increase. That said, the company’s performance was down on a year-over-year basis due to weaker refining operations, which are being impacted by narrower WTI to Brent crude spreads. Below, we take a look at how the company fared in recent years and what the outlook could be like.
