Now that Christmas has come and gone, and my stomach somehow remains full from all the pecan pie and sweet potatoes I filled it with on Monday, it is time to take a look back at the events of 2017 and assess the status of the domestic oil and gas industry as the year comes to a close. To paraphrase a standard line that every U.S. president uses in every annual state of the union message, the state of the industry as 2017 comes to a close is strong. Yes, "strong" is a good word for it. As in, surprisingly strong, unexpectedly strong, stronger than the industry had any right to realistically hope for as the year dawned 12 months ago. Let's look at some of the reasons why that is the case: All things considered, 2017 produced a veritable sea-change in the outlook for the U.S. oil and gas industry , a true turnaround from the bleak years of 2014-16. While it's not a return to the heady days of $100 oil or $12 natural gas - two things we are unlikely to see again for a generation, perhaps ever - the relative health of the industry today as compared to a year before is dramatically improved, and really more than any industry participant could have reasonably hoped for. In my next piece, I'll provide my annual forecast of what to expect for the U.S. industry in 2018. Stay tuned.
