Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) recently posted its Q1 results, which were below the street estimates, due to a lackluster performance of its downstream operations. The stock price reacted negatively with roughly 4% cut, post-earnings announcement. The company’s upstream business did well, as expected, given higher price realization for its liquids. However, the chemicals business struggled, as higher realizations were offset by increased feedstock costs. We continue to believe that the company’s near term growth will depend on its upstream business, which will likely move higher given the recent trend in the oil prices. Separately, the company recently announced its acquisition of Indonesian lubricant firm, Federal, in a $436 million deal. We have created an interactive dashboard on Exxon Mobil’s expected performance for 2018. You can adjust the revenue and margin drivers to see the impact on the company’s performance. Expect Crude Oil, NGL, And Other Upstream Business To Drive Near Term Growth We estimate the Crude Oil, NGL, & Other Liquids segment revenues to grow in low-double-digits in 2018. While we don’t expect much change in the production, the average crude oil and NGL sale price is estimated to see a 15% jump to $56. This is slightly lower than the company’s first quarter realization of $60 for the U.S., and $58 for Non-U.S. crude. Our forecast is based on the recent trend seen in oil prices. OPEC continues to be committed to production cuts through the end of the year. This will likely aid the growth in oil prices. Furthermore, recent tensions in Syria, over alleged use of chemical weapons, and the turmoil in the Venezuelan economy, have further pushed the prices higher to $68 levels.
