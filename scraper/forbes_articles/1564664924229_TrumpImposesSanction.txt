Topline: The Trump administration imposed potentially ineffective sanctions Wednesday on Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif and said he’s a “propaganda arm” for Iran’s supreme leader, two moves further complicating any possibility of diplomacy.   Key background: The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Iran multiple times since the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. As the sanctions crippled Iran’s economy, tensions have steadily escalated between Iran and the West. In May and June, two different oil tanker attacks occurred off Iran’s coast. Iran denied involvement, but the U.S. blamed the nation for both incidents. When Iran downed a U.S. Navy drone in June, the incident led to Iran severing diplomatic ties with America. Meanwhile, Iran announced in July that it exceeded the limit of enriched uranium in the Obama-era nuclear deal but insisted it would use the material for peaceful purposes only. Iran’s seizure of a British oil tanker and claims it captured CIA spies, also in July, further amped up tensions that show no sign of easing.
