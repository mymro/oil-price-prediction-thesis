We are reducing our price estimate for Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), the second-largest oilfield services provider, from about $40 per share to around $30 per share. While oil prices have posted some gains this year, the company could face weaker long-term revenue growth in its bread-and-butter North American market, where investors have been calling for oil and gas companies (Halliburton’s customers) to slash investment and boost returns. While pricing in North America is improving, margins are unlikely to return to levels seen pre-2014. This could be an issue for Halliburton, as it derived about 60% of revenue from North America in 2018, with a bulk of it coming from unconventionals. Below, we take a look at the near-term outlook for the company. View our interactive dashboard analysis on What Are The Trends Driving Our $30 Price Estimate For Halliburton?
