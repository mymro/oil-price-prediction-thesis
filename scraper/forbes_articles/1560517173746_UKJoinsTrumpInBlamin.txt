(Updated: 2:51 p.m.) Topline: During a Friday morning television interview, President Trump rebuffed Iran's denial of responsibility for oil tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman. British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt agreed with the president in a Friday interview with BBC Radio. "We have no reason not to believe the American assessment and our instinct is to believe it because they are our closest ally," said Hunt. The Kokuka Courageous and Front Altair were traveling through the Strait of Hormuz on Thursday, a chokepoint for approximately 40% of the global oil supply, when they sustained multiple explosions, causing fires on board both ships. Forty-three total crew members were evacuated from both ships, with no fatalities reported. A U.S. Navy destroyer aided the damaged tankers with help from Iran. Although Iran’s foreign minister claimed the attacks were suspicious, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Thursday from the Department of State that U.S. intelligence believes Iran is behind the attacks. Key background: The attacks coincided with a diplomatic visit from Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe designed to ease tensions between Iran and the U.S. Yesterday’s attacks followed an incident in May, in which four oil tankers were attacked by what the U.S. claims were Iranian mines. Iran denied involvement in the May attacks.
