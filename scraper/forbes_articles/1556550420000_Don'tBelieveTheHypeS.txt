This month's bond sale by Saudi Arabia's oil firm Aramco has taken the investing world by storm. However, you shouldn't buy into the hype. That's because when you look beyond the headlines, the real reason for the sale is not as it may first seem, according to a recent report. The state-owned oil giant sold $12 billion of bonds earlier this month and was so oversubscribed that it managed to get the deal done at borrowing costs that were better than the country that owns it -- Saudi Arabia. That's a rare event anywhere in the world as most companies pay more than do their governments. Cause for pause? It sounds great. But the ulterior motives may give investors cause for pause.
