Here’s The Daily Chart for Crude Oil The daily chart for Nymex crude oil shows the formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders bottom with my semiannual pivot at $50.84 and my monthly and quarterly risky levels at $56.20 and $60.16, respectively. Note that a “death cross” set on November 26 remains in play with the 200-day simple moving average at $64.35. The Daily Chart for Chevron The daily chart shows that Chevron has been below a death cross since September 12 when the 50-day simple moving average fell below the 200-day simple moving average. This bearish signal tracked the stock to its December 26 low of $100.22. The stock is below its 200-day simple moving average at $119.91. The 2018 close of $108.79 was the input to my proprietary analytics that resulted in the four horizontal lines shown on the chart. My semiannual value level is $106.15 with my monthly and quarterly pivots at $111.76 and $112.24, respectively, and my annual risky level at $131.43. The Weekly Chart for Chevron The weekly chart for Chevron is positive with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $112.97 and above its 200-week simple moving average or reversion to the mean at $107.07. The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading rose to 47.90 last week, up from 42.23 on January 18. Given these charts and analysis, buy weakness to the 200-week SMA of $107.07 and my semiannual value level at $106.15 and reduce holdings on strength to the 200-day SMA at $119.91. Aggressive buyers can add to holdings at my quarterly and monthly pivots at $112.24 and $111.76, respectively. The Daily Chart for ExxonMobil The daily chart shows that Exxon has been below a death cross since December 14 when the 50-day simple moving average fell below the 200-day simple moving average. This bearish warning tracked the stock to its December 26 low of $64.65. The 200-day SMA is $79.41. The 2018 close of $68.19 was the input to my proprietary analytics, which resulted in the three horizontal lines on chart. My semiannual and quarterly value levels are $69.47 and $66.87, respectively, with my monthly risky level at $79.19. My annual risky level is above the chart at $94.26. The Weekly Chart for Exxon Mobil The weekly chart for ExxonMobil needs a close on Friday above its five-week modified moving average of $73.15 to be positive. The stock is below its 200-week simple moving average of reversion to the mean of 62.05. The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading rose to 50.99 last week, up from 26.87 on January 18. Given these charts and analysis, buy weakness to my semiannual and quarterly value levels of $69.47 and $66.87, respectively, and reduce holdings on strength to my monthly risky level at $79.19 and the 200-day and 200-week simple moving averages at $79.41 and $82.05, respectively. ----
