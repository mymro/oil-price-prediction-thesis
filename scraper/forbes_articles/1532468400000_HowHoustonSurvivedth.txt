In November 2014, OPEC announced it would no longer serve as swing producer in world oil markets, triggering what would arguably become the worst downtufurn in the history of American oil. Based on the rate of decline of the rig count, the number of rigs left working at the worst of it, the lost oil jobs or the fall in capital expenditure, the 2015-16 oil downturn rivaled or exceeded that of the 1980s. However, the story for Houston’s economy was very different. Between 1982 and 1986, for example, Houston suffered its worst recession ever, losing 211,000 jobs or about one job in 12. In contrast, 2015-16 brought the local metro area a loss of only 4,300 jobs overall, or about 0.1% of payroll employment, making it the mildest of any oil-related downturn in local history. This improved performance was not because Houston was somehow immune to the oil price collapse. Before 2014, the city was riding a huge boom in oil-related activity, and its abrupt end spelled the loss of 74,200 local oil-related jobs over the following two years. Figure 1 shows that at the cyclical peak in both 1982 and 2014, Houston had a similar number of oil-related jobs, and as losses mounted, both cycles followed a very similar path.    Offsetting Losses to Oil There were probably three key factors that helped Houston’s economy offset the 2015-16 losses in the oil sector: continued growth of the U.S. economy, sustained momentum from a decade of boom-time growth, and a huge petrochemical construction boom driven by low natural gas prices. This combination added up to just enough to offset a serious setback in oil employment. How did all this add up for Houston’s economy? The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas publishes a business cycle index for Houston that is specifically designed to track the local business cycle. The index includes four variables: payroll employment, the unemployment rate, real wages, and real retail sales. (Figure 2) From 2001-03, for example, the index says that the U.S. tech bust pushed Houston into its mildest recession since 1972, a 2.5% decline measured peak to trough. In 2008-09, the Great Recession saw Houston’s index fell much further, to 7.9%. If we had included the 1982-86 period in the chart, it would have shown a local economic collapse of 18.0%. In 2015-16, it remains a close call as to whether Houston had a recession or not. The index fell only 1.6% over the period, less than the 2.5% of the “mildest-ever” recession of the Tech Bust period. Some economists define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline, and Houston’s index fell for each of the last three quarters of 2016. But the combined fall was less than 1%, with most of it concentrated in the second quarter of the year. If we choose to call 2015-16 a recession, it is now Houston’s shallowest since 1972. Is Houston’s Business Cycle Now Weaned from Oil? If 2015-16 brought a serious oil downturn but only limited damage to the local economy, has Houston been weaned from oil and its business cycle tamed? Unfortunately, it is not that simple. In should first be noted that the Houston/oil nexus definitely got a bad rap from events of the 1980s. The 1982 bust was never just about oil prices and has never served as a guide to the city’s future. Oil was an important ingredient, but the ‘80s came with a major U.S. recession, badly misguided federal energy policies and a real estate and banking bust of epic proportions. Fortunately, most of these mistakes won’t or can’t easily be repeated. Some claim that Houston’s 2015-16 performance was the result of Houston diversifying away from oil, leaving the local economy less susceptible to the oil-price cycle. We can’t make any comparison of today’s local economy to the 1980s, because the government’s industrial classification system changed completely after 1990. But since 1990, there is no evidence of a long-term structural shift in Houston that indicates less dependence on oil markets. Houston did well because the oil and natural gas markets have been decoupled and the boom in chemicals manufacturing (the other part of the energy industry) was largely the driver of the market in Houston. Most of the credit for Houston’s relative stability in 2015-16 must go to the positive performance of the U.S. economy. Before 2014, every local recession was first brought on by a setback to the U.S. or global economy, quickly followed by a decline in demand for oil. The 2015-16 oil price collapse was different: it was initiated by an oversupply of global oil from new U.S. fracking technology, and lower oil prices simply stimulated the U.S. economy to roll right on. The more typical one-two blow of recession followed by oil-price collapse can still be brutal in Houston, as we have seen as recently as the 2008-09 downturn led by the Great Recession. This combination will likely be seen in Houston again and again – as long as the business cycle persists, and as long as Houston’s economy and oil markets remain thoroughly intermingled.
