Brazilian oil firm Petrobras saw its credit rating take a hit yet again on Tuesday. Fitch has them even junkier than before, now at BB- from BB. The outlook remains stable, an improvement from Fitch's negative outlook which ultimately led to the rating downgrade. Petrobras is the country's flagship enterprise. It rose to prominence in the early 2000s following hydrocarbon discoveries deep under the ocean's surface. It borrowed heavily to extract it all, and buy floating rigs. It became one of the most heavily indebted oil firms in the world. When the Brazilian economy crashed, following a massive corruption scandal involving fraud at the highest levels of the company, every rating agency slashed Petrobras' credit rating. New executives have been slow to sell assets to the market due to lower oil prices leading to lower sales prices for what Petrobras wanted to sell. Petrobras has well over $100 billion in short an long-term debt. There is also some new political risk involved here. Should a left of center candidate win the election next year, they could possibly reverse a ruling that gives Petrobras the right not to participate in deepwater oilfield drilling. This means new well auctions that used to require Petrobras be lead operator no longer requires such action by the heavily indebted oil firm. If a new president demanded Petrobras return to be lead operator in all oil fields off Brazil's cost, the credit rating would undoubtedly take another hit. Petrobras wasn't the only brand named corporate giant on Fitch's downgrade list today. O Globo -- the media company many Brazilians love to hate -- lost their investment grade rating on Tuesday. Fitch was the last of three major credit rating agencies to strip them of their BBB status. Globo's foreign currency bonds are now rated BB+, one notch below investment grade.
