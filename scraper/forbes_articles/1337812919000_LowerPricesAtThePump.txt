The good news for U.S. consumers is that the price of crude oil and gasoline have both been dropping steadily. The bad news is that gas prices have not been coming down nearly as much as oil. West Texas Intermediate Crude for July delivery dropped below $90 per barrel in NYMEX trading on Wednesday, down 16.7% from its $108.20 high on March 1. The national average price of unleaded gasoline at the pump peaked at $3.92 in the first week of April and now stands at $3.689 per gallon, according to Gasbuddy.com. That's a drop of 5.9%. Shares of oil producers and refiners have taken a hit from the lower oil and gas prices, but some not as badly as others. The overall energy sector, tracked by the XLE ETF, is down 8% so far in May, while integrated oil companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron have fared better, down 4.3% and 6.3% this month. Valero Energy, a refiner, is down 9.5%. Even if gas prices are not dropping as quickly as oil prices, there is still reason to cheer the lower prices. An infographic prepared by Blue Glass Interactive shows how higher gas prices have historically preceded periods of rising unemployment. President Obama should also be happy, as presidents have a hard time winning reelection when gas prices are rising. (Blue Glass prepared the graphic last month but I was waiting for gas prices to go back up before I used it. I don't want to wait any longer.)
