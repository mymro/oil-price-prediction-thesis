This is an interesting little question. Why has the Caracas stock market risen 250% over this past year, having pretty much flatlined for the previous four? It's not as if there's been any particularly great international economic news recently. Venezuela's economy is indeed heavily oil based but the oil price has been high for some time and has been coming down over the past couple of months so that is unlikely to be it. And given that almost all of the country's oil industry is nationalised that's not going to drive the index very much anyway. I have a feeling that this is the correct explanation: Yes, it's politics. As you can see from the chart the real boom started in February: the time when Chavez announced that he needed further cancer treatment. There is indeed that fct that there is only one major challenger to him in the coming elections as well. I think it's safe to say that the boom is something to do with the possibility, whether through electoral defeat or illness that Chavez might not be President for that much longer. Which leaves us with the following little problem. Is the market rising as the capitalists lick their lips at the coming potential for exploitation of the Venezuelan population? As Chavez, the man who stops this, retires from the scene? Or is it anticipation of how the economy will grow as various socialist idiocies are repealed? Which answer you choose is likely to reflect your own prejudices about the desirability of capitalism or socialism.
