Alaska Airlines (NYSE: ALK) is slated to release its full-year 2019 results on Tuesday, January 28. The earnings season has been a mixed bag for the U.S. airline industry so far, with American Airlines and Southwest Airlines falling short of expectations even as JetBlue, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines reported stronger-than-expected results. So which of its competitors’ results is Alaska Airlines likely to have emulated? Trefis details expectations from the airline company in an interactive dashboard, parts of which we highlight below. We believe that Alaska Airlines will report an earnings miss for FY19 despite churning out revenues that are in-line with consensus. We expect Alaska Airlines to report total revenues of $8.9 billion (vs. consensus estimate of $8.9 billion) primarily driven by the company’s passenger division. Also, earnings are likely to be around $6.30 (vs. consensus estimate of $6.36), growing by 9% (y-o-y) due to lower fuel costs. In 2019, while Southwest Airlines and American Airlines faced headwinds from the Boeing 737 MAX groundings, Alaska Airlines’ revenues continued to expand from stable capacity and rising airfares. We estimate Alaska Airlines’ valuation to be $70 a share – roughly 10% above its current price. Trefis shines the spotlight on key assumptions and data for Alaska Airlines, and our hypothesis lays out one possible set of expectations.
