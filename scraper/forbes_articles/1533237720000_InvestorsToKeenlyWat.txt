Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras (NYSE:PBR), the Brazilian integrated energy company, is slated to post its June quarter financial results before the market opens on 3rd August 2018((Petrobras To Announce June Quarter 2018 Results, 30th July 2018, www.petrobras.com)). Similar to the last quarter, the company is likely to deliver a notable improvement in its revenue as well as earnings due to higher volumes and better price realizations. However, the company’s CEO Pedro Parente resigned due to the rising pressure amid the truck strike in the country. As a result, Ivan Monteiro, who has been Petrobras’ Chief Financial and Investor Relations Officer since February 2015, was appointed as the new CEO of the company. We will keenly watch for the outlook that the new CEO will outline for the company in the latest earnings release. We have a price estimate of $15 per share for the company, which is higher than its current market price.
