Airbus rebranded the Bombardier C Series aircraft family as the A220-100 and A220-300 on Tuesday and announced a big sale of the planes to JetBlue. Airbus marks its commercial aircraft as A3XX, but using A220 as the new family number fits the shift to smaller narrowbody regional jets. Eric Schultz, Airbus’ chief commercial officer, said there's healthy interest from airlines in the A220. “We trust that this segment could total as many as 7,200 aircraft over the next 20 years–that’s an exciting prospect,” Schultz said. JetBlue gave the newly rebranded A220s a huge boost today by ordering 60 planes that will replace its fleet of 60 Embraer 190s. JetBlue will start taking delivery in 2020, and the deal includes an option to purchase an additional 60 aircraft from 2025. AirBaltic, which has committed to operating single type C-Series fleet as part of its Destination 2025 strategy, demonstrated its commitment to the aircraft by placing orders for up to 60 new jets this May and expressed its support today for the rebranding. “We’re glad to join the Airbus Family with Bombardier CS300 officially becoming Airbus A220-300. We are looking forward to introducing an all-Airbus fleet,” the airline Tweeted. Delta’s 2016 order of 75 planes was also a significant vote of confidence in the long-term viability of this aircraft. The C-Series—now A220—offers passengers comfort features that match new generation planes including more room, large windows and programmable mood lighting, and digital passenger service units that can display information including a digital flight map. Airbus plans to integrate features of its Airspace cabin design into the C-Series to achieve greater “seamlessness” of experience across Airbus models. But any modifications are more likely motivated by supply chain efficiencies, to Airbus’ advantage. Philippe Balducchi, president of CSALP—the new Airbus partnership with Canada’s Bombardier—said a ramp-up of production in anticipation of new orders is already underway. Boeing- Embraer Boeing announced a joint venture with Embraer that would add the Brazilian manufacturer’s E2 regional jets to the Boeing product offering. This puts Boeing in a position to directly compete with the A220. Airbus knocked the growing variety of the Boeing product line during its presentations for the reveal of the A220, suggesting that its line up of five narrowbody aircraft types (A220-100, A220-300, A319neo, A320neo and A321neo) is more likely to succeed than Boeing’s combined lineup of seven aircraft types—with the Embraer E195E2 and E190E2 regional jets included. Boeing’s second-quarter deliveries, released today, suggest that the U.S. airframe manufacturer has little to worry about. The manufacturer delivered 137 of its 737 line this quarter, 269 so far this year. It has increased aircraft deliveries by 7% during the first half of 2018 over last year. Boeing also netted 460 new aircraft orders during this period, compared to Airbus’ 206 net orders, as Reuters reports. The Puget Sound Business Journal has reported that Boeing and Embraer may collaborate on a future 737 replacement. The Journal cites a report by analyst Saj Ahmad of StrategicAero Reseach in which Ahmad describes the Boeing-Embraer partnership as more advantageous and offers a harsh take of the long-term success of the Airbus-Bombardier collaboration, referring to its “abject market irrelevance.” The Boeing-Embraer deal is more versatile and supports the advancement of new aircraft in both the military and commercial sector, Ahmad says, including possibly Boeing’s NMA 797 aircraft. The view that Embraer may help advance the 797 is shared by Scott Hamilton of Leeham News. Flight Global reported that Boeing registered ‘797’ European Union Intellectual Property Office in August of last year, perhaps as a warning shot to Airbus that Boeing means business. With the Farnborough Airshow coming up next week, all eyes will be on whether Boeing makes a formal announcement on the 797 and what orders go where on regional jets. Reuters reported that higher oil prices are expected to stimulate the market, leading to as many as 900 new aircraft orders during the Airshow.
