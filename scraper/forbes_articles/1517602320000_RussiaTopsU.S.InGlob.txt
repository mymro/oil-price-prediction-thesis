Russia is No. 1. The U.S. is No. 9. Will the omnipotence of Vladimir Putin ever cease? He's at it again, with the state-controlled gas giant Gazprom ranked the top integrated oil and gas company of 2017, according to the S&P Platts Top 250 global energy company list. Let me guess: fake news? Russian hackers manipulated the list? Putin has S&P Platts editors on the FSB's payroll? We all 'know' he has the President of the United States, Republican leadership of the House Intelligence Committee, blockchain company Ethereum, cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab, and maybe even Breitbart on the Kremlin's payroll. Stepping aside from the media hysterics and coming back down to reality, the S&P list looks at the top global oil and gas producers, refiners and electric power companies. Russia is the only country with two integrated oil and gas firms in the top 10. That would be Gazprom, controlled by the state, and Lukoil, controlled by Forbes-listed billionaire and its shareholders. The U.S. has two industry firms in the top 10, with Exxon as the only integrated one and Valero Energy for its refining business. The No. 1 refiner on the list was India's Reliance Industries. Within the top 10, only Russia, the U.S., and India have two companies represented. Middle East and OPEC companies like PdVSA of Venezuela are not on the list. The Russians and Americans are going head-to-head in a global oil and gas market that was once dominated by OPEC. Today, the old Cold War rivals are the main price drivers. Russian exploration and production firms Novatek and Tatneft made the top 50 and were ranked highest in their industry. The full report can be seen here.
