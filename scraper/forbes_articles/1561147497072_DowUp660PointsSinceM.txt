Topline: Despite escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, June is on pace for the best stock performance in over 50 years, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing Friday having almost reached its all-time high, while the S&P 500 rose nearly 70 points for the week, most likely due to potential interest rate cuts. Key background: Friday’s performance is remarkable because of the Iran situation. After the Fed foreshadowed interest rate cuts this year, markets opened higher on Thursday morning. Then Trump hinted of a potential retaliatory strike on Iran, in response to Iran’s shooting down a U.S. Navy drone, which he didn’t follow through on. Markets dropped after Trump’s comment, but rebounded by Thursday’s close, with the S&P closing at an all-time high. Market shakiness in recent weeks was caused by investors’ nervousness around slowing economic growth, attributed to President Trump’s tariff showdowns with Mexico and China. But markets picked up again after Fed chairman Jerome Powell hinted June 4 of possible interest rate cuts, and doubly so after his Wednesday announcement. Investors are eyeing next week’s G-20 Summit and specifically Trump’s scheduled meeting on trade with China’s president XI Jinping for risk signals.
