Trefis details expectations from the airline company in an interactive dashboard, parts of which we highlight below. We believe that American Airlines will report stronger-than-expected earnings for FY 2019. We expect American to report total revenues of $45.7 billion (identical to the consensus estimate of $45.7 billion), driven by the company’s passenger division. Also, earnings are likely to be $5.00 (vs. consensus estimate of $4.55), growing by 10% (y-o-y) primarily due to lower fuel costs. Though the U.S. airline industry faced a capacity shortage in 2019, we believe that investors are unduly pessimistic about American Airlines and estimate its valuation to be $34 a share – roughly 20% above its current price of $28.
