Natural gas prices have been trapped in the historically low winter range of $2.60 to $3.10 per MMBtu for prompt month contract for many weeks now. The past week, however, February contract was up 13%, to close at $3.20 on Friday. The clear lid on the U.S. gas market is surging production. Although the recent Polar Vortex 2.0 dropped national output to 71 Bcf/d due to some well freeze offs, we saw record numbers of 77-78 Bcf/d in the previous weeks. According to the U.S. Department of Energy here, production in 2017 averaged about 74 Bcf/d but is expected to average 80-81 Bcf/d this year and 83-84 Bcf/d in 2019. This non-stop surge in U.S. gas production is hugely impressive: in its most recently projection on January 9 here, the DOE forecast Henry Hub gas prices to actually fall this year to $2.88, compared to $2.99 in 2017, and rising to just $2.92 in 2018. Remember: lower prices make it harder, not easier, to produce, yet 2018 is expected to see the largest output growth in our history. One of the reasons current prices don't impact output as much as some Americans might think is because producers often hedge future production. Take the main region of new supply, Appalachia, which holds the Marcellus and Utica shale plays. Appalachia is now producing about 35% of all U.S. natural gas, and could reach an astounding 40 to 45 Bcf/d over the next 7 to 10 years. The region's top producers have more 2018 production volumes hedged than other U.S. gas producers, largely because that market is glutted, and there's not enough pipelines to move gas out to market. Aside from the recent price spike because of extreme cold, spot prices in Appalachia are usually discount Henry Hub (which is far south in Erath, Louisiana) by $0.50 to $1.00 or more. As seen in the first figure below, the huge price swing of Dominion South, a man hub in Appalachia located 40 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, explains why local producers would seek to hedge more than others - more than just discounted...prices were up, plummeted, and then went up again. Hedging reduces the impact of unanticipated price declines (price risk) on revenues. Overall, U.S. gas producers have hedged less than 40% of their 2018 expected output, down from closer to 50% in 2017. In contrast, Appalachia's key producers have more than half of their output hedged in 2018, at a volume-weighted average price of $3.15. And even this high number is off because it's being skewed by Cabot Oil & Gas, the largest producer in Pennsylvania that hasn't hedged any of the 2.15 Bcf/d the company is expected to produce in 2018. In contrast again, Antero has been locking in 100% or more of its production in recent years, and the company has earned more than $1 billion through a stock offering and changes to its hedging strategy to support year-on-year production growth of 20-22% through 2020. In 2017, gas hedging was more stable than oil because gas prices were more stable. For example, monthly Henry Hub pricing ranged from $2.81 to $3.30 (here), versus WTI ranging from $45.18 to $57.88 (here). Although in the third quarter of 2017, gas hedges were down some 30% from the second quarter, with most being added at Henry Hub prices between $3.00 and $3.40. Finally, there's no question that rising DOE projections for U.S. gas production themselves are helping to keep prices down, easing doubt of future supply shortages.
