Earlier this year, The World Bank published data showing the countries that received the most remittances in 2018. In total, global remittances reached $689 billion in 2018, up from $633 billion in 2017. The vast majority of the money flowed into low- and middle-income countries where remittances totalled $529 billion. Stronger economic conditions in the United States and increasing oil prices drove the upsurge with growth in South Asia particularly strong at 12%. India's massive diaspora helped it retain its position as the world's top recipient of remittances and they sent an impressive $79 billion home in 2018.  Remittance flows have been increasing steadily in India in recent years, climbing from $62.7 billion in 2016 to $65.3 billion in 2017. The World Bank said that the 14% growth in India last year is likely to have been boosted by a flooding disaster in Kerala which prompted migrants to send more financial aid to their families. China can also count on a huge diaspora and it comes second on the list of remittance recipients with $67 billion. Mexico came third with $36 billion followed by the Philippines ($34 billion) and Egypt ($29 billion). The World Bank noted that the cost for sending remittances home can prove high. In the first quarter of 2019, the average cost of sending $200 home came to approximately 7%.  *Click below to enlarge (charted by Statista)
