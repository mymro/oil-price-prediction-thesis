The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat has released its review of global skyscraper construction in 2019. 126 buildings at least 200 meters tall were built across the globe compared to 146 in 2018, representing a 13.7% decline. Nevertheless, 2019 was still noteworthy with 26 supertall buildings 300 meters tall or higher completed, the most in any year. The Tianjin CTF Finance Centre is 2019's tallest skyscraper and at 530 meters it's China's joint third-tallest building together with its sister tower, the Guangzhou CTF Finance Centre. 2019 was the fifth year in a row where China completed the tallest building. The second-tallest building of 2019 was the 462-meter-tall Lakhta Center (also known as the Gazprom Tower) in St. Petersburg, Russia while the third-tallest was once again in China, the Suzhou IFS which stands at 456 meters. As in previous years, no country came close to China in 2019 for skyscraper construction. 56 buildings at least 200 meters tall were completed over the course of the year, considerably fewer than the 88 built in 2018. Shenzhen saw the most completions out of all Chinese cities last year with 15, followed by Chonqing's eight. The United States had the second-highest skyscraper tally last year but even then, it built fewer of them than Shenzen. The U.S. had 14 completions and 30 Hudson Yards in New York was America's tallest skyscraper of 2019 at a height of 387 meters. The United Arab Emirates came third with nine completions, down from 10 in 2018. Last year, several new skyscraper records were set such as Algeria finishing the Great Mosque of Algiers which has become the tallest building on the African continent. Likewise, the Lakhta Center mentioned above has now become Europe's new tallest building. In 2020, the research predicts somewhere between 115 and 145 completions of 200-meter-plus buildings. *Click below to enlarge (charted by Statista)
