We forecast Royal Dutch Shell to post a modest revenue decline and adjusted EPS of $4.70 in 2018. We expect its Upstream business to see a low double digit gain, which will likely be offset by a modest decline in the downstream business. 2017 was a good year for oil companies, as growth in WTI crude prices aided their margins, and Royal Dutch Shell in particular benefited from its massive divestments. Similarly, in 2018, the average WTI crude oil price is expected to be $56, representing a 10% jump from the 2017 average. This should bode well for the company’s upstream operations in 2018, and the company’s $5 billion annual divestment target will further aid its overall performance. We have created an interactive dashboard on Royal Dutch Shell’s expected performance for 2018. You can adjust the revenue and margin drivers to see the impact on the company’s performance. Below we discuss our expectations and forecasts for the company. Expect Upstream Business To Drive Growth In 2018 We estimate Royal Dutch Shell’s Upstream revenues to grow roughly 11% in 2018. While we don’t expect much change in the production, the average crude oil and NGL sale price is estimated to see a 3% jump to $51. Our forecast is based on the fact that OPEC and its allies have committed to production cuts, which is likely to keep oil prices higher, as compared to the prior year. Having said that, there is a risk of OPEC changing its course, given a surge in oil exports from the U.S. to Asia. Moreover, increased supply from the U.S. shale producers can keep the price in check. Within the Upstream segment, we expect the Natural Gas business to see low single digit revenue growth, primarily led by higher price realization. It should be noted that Royal Dutch Shell’s Natural Gas price realization has declined from the peak of $6.85 in 2008 to $3.16 in 2016. However, it increased to $3.83 in 2017, due to higher demand. The overall gas demand in 2017 was high, which led to lower average inventory levels, thereby pushing the prices higher. Looking forward, natural gas prices are expected to remain steady in 2018. The benchmark Henry Hub natural gas spot price is expected to average around $2.99/MMBtu in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which is similar to the 2017 average. The company’s Downstream segment volume has been stable around 320 Mil over the last three years. However, the price realization per metric ton has fluctuated in the recent past. The figure was on a decline from 2012 till 2016. It surged sharply by 32% to $832 in 2017. However, we estimate the average revenue to decline in low single digits in 2018 given that any significant growth in crude oil prices is unlikely, and it is expected to remain rangebound around the $54 mark. Forecast Strong Earnings Growth In 2018 We forecast Royal Dutch Shell’s Net Income Margin to increase in 2018, primarily due to lower costs, as we expect higher price realization for its Upstream operations. With 5.7% Net Income Margin, and 4.1 Bil shares, we arrive at earnings per share of $4.73. We estimate a price-earnings multiple of around 14.5 for Royal Dutch Shell, which is below many oil industry multiples, reflecting the risk of volatility in oil prices impacting the company’s future growth. This translates into a price estimate of $68 for Royal Dutch Shell’s stock, which is more than 5% above the current market price.
