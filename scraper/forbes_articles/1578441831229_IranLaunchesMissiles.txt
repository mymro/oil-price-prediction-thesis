Topline: Iran has fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two air bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops, the Pentagon said Tuesday, in retaliation for President Donald Trump’s killing of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Chief critics: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted that “America & world cannot afford war.” “We must ensure the safety of our servicemembers, including ending needless provocations from the Administration and demanding that Iran cease its violence,” she said. Key background: The U.S. and Iran have been on a collision course since Trump backed out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. But tensions escalated further last week when Trump ordered the air strike that killed Soleimani, a prominent military leader in the country who has assisted and funded a network of proxy militias, including Hezbollah and Hamas. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said Tuesday that Soleimani was planning an attack on U.S. interests within days of his death, but did not offer any details about the intelligence underpinning those plans. Democrats, meanwhile, called the air strike a reckless decision that bring the U.S. closer to an unnecessary war with Iran. Trump has vowed to hit back at Iran in response to any attack, saying that he would target Iranian cultural sites (although the Pentagon later ruled that out, acknowledging it would be a war crime).
