Topline: Shortly after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said a U.S./China trade deal was “90%” done, President Trump went on television early Wednesday to say he’s considering more tariffs, sending conflicting signals to the stock market. Key background: Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping’s Saturday meeting would restart trade talks after breaking down in May, due to China’s refusal to alleviate U.S. concerns over intellectual property theft, currency manipulation and forced technology transfers. Trump then banned Chinese telecom manufacturers (like Huawei) from selling to the U.S. Prior to May, both countries imposed yearlong tariffs on each other’s imports, moves that rattled the global economy. Depending on the outcome of Saturday’s talks, markets could react negatively in anticipation of a global recession.
