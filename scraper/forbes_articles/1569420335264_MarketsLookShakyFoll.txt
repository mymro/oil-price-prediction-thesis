Topline: Political uncertainty was expected to continue to take a toll on the market going into Wednesday, as futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were mixed. But both indexes dropped slightly at the open. Key background: Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced yesterday that the House of Representatives would begin a formal impeachment investigation into President Trump, causing the S&P 500 to fall 0.8% after the reports surfaced—the largest one-day drop in a month. What to watch for: U.S. politics will be central to financial headlines on Wednesday, as investors wait to see how the impeachment inquiry plays out—and what it could mean for the market. Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff said in a tweet yesterday that the whistleblower from Trump’s phone call with the Ukrainian president intends to testify and could do so this week.
