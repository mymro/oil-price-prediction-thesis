It may sound counterintuitive. But there’s a good chance Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is secretly hoping one of his colleagues will vote against another interest rate increase later this month. Why would the chairman of a consensus-seeking Federal Open Market Committee want one his colleagues to break ranks? One word: signaling. The Fed appears to be coming awfully close to the point when it at least wavers about tightening monetary policy further. That was already the case before financial markets fell out of bed this week, with stock and oil prices plunging and market expectations for future growth prospects and inflation taking a dive. The steep losses, which have raised worries about financial stability, come amid concerns that a trade war between the United States and China, the world’s two largest economies, is likely to gain momentum after a wobbly deal struck over the G20 meeting raised more questions than answers. A troubling market trend that usually precedes recessions where long-term bond yields slip below their short-term counterparts, known as a yield-curve inversion, also raised fresh concerns about the economy. That’s why a dissent by one or more Fed officials might actually send a strong signal to the markets that this is a "dovish hike" – one that likely presages a pause if not an end to rate hikes. Who might move against the committee? Fed dissents are fairly rare, especially within the central bank’s board. That leaves the four regional Fed presidents who are currently voting members (they rotate on a regular basis). Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester is probably too hawkish, favoring more, not fewer rate increases. That leaves Mary Daly of the San Francisco Fed, Raphael Bostic at the Atlanta Fed or Thomas Barkin of the Richmond Fed. Is a new voice for caution on rate hikes about to speak out at the U.S. central bank? We shall see, at exactly 2 p.m. on Wednesday, December 19.
