Last Friday, oil prices fell for the 10th consecutive day. According to CNBC, this marks the longest losing streak for crude oil in 34 years. I have covered the factors behind this drop in the previous two articles. To recap, the loss of China as an export market for U.S. oil producers has caused crude inventories in the U.S. to swell, and the Trump Administration's weakening of imminent sanctions on Iran have both been large factors in the decline. Matt Badiali, senior research analyst at Banyan Hill, thinks the decline is now overdone. Matt says that from April to September, Iran cut 830,000 bbl/day of exports. But Saudi Arabia and the U.S. expanded production by more than that, so the world didn't feel the pinch. As Matt explained to me: Michael Bertuccio, President & CEO of HB2 Energy, also noted that refinery maintenance may be contributing to the perception of an oversupplied market: Michael agrees that global demand remains strongâ€”including Chinese demand. He believes exports will accelerate with upcoming pipeline infrastructure and the wide basis spreads will compress towards Brent, which is a better benchmark of global oil values. One thing is for certain. Oil prices are on sale relative to where they were a month ago. It appears unlikely to me that a continued decline is supported by fundamentals, especially if the U.S. stops granting waivers on Iranian oil imports in six months -- as is the stated intent.
