Move over trade wars. The Trump administration now seems to be gunning for the real thing.  The U.S. president has stoked tensions in the Middle East to a boiling point after the Pentagon announced Trump had approved the killing of Iran’s top military commander, Qasem Soleimani, in what has been widely described as a dangerous and provocative military action.  Oil prices surged 4% and stocks fell sharply as Iran’s vow of “harsh revenge” raised uncertainty about global energy costs.  While the potential economic drag from any increased military conflict in the region or in proxy conflicts around the world remains unpredictable, the trepidation itself is enough to fan worries of an even more pronounced slowdown was already baked into 2020 forecasts.  The fears of outright war in some form between Washington and Tehran came on the back of Trump’s ever-tangled trade wars, which have been a drag on global economic growth for some time.  Data from the Institute for Supply Management showed the U.S. manufacturing sinking deeper into contraction, with the headline index falling to a 10-year low of 47.2 in the final month of the year. The December reading “was the lowest reported since June 2009 and there was weakness evident in many of the survey’s underlying components,” wrote J.P. Morgan economist Daniel Silver in a research note.  “We had thought that the deescalation in trade tensions over the past few months would help boost business sentiment and would benefit business investment. But the ISM survey has continued to weaken lately and most measures of manufacturing activity have remained soft.”
