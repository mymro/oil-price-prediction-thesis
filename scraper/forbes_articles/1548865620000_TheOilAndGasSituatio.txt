During the course of a radio appearance I made on January 29 (BYU Radio's "Top of Mind" program hosted by Julie Rose) I was reminded of just how little most Americans really understand about oil and gas in general, and how the gasoline or diesel they use in their cars is manufactured and delivered to their local gas stations. That's not a criticism of ordinary Americans, because 98% of them have no real need to understand such things in the course of their lives, and our system of education does almost nothing to educate them about this particular topic. Nor is it a criticism of Ms. Rose, who herself is extremely knowledgeable, but poses questions she knows most of her listeners are wondering about. Given all of that, I have endeavored here to put together seven key things to know about oil and gasoline that might help the average person better understand this key element in their daily lives: So there you are: Answers to seven basic questions about our current situation with crude oil and its major by-product, gasoline. Now you can commit them to memory and bore your guests to tears by repeating them at your next dinner party.
