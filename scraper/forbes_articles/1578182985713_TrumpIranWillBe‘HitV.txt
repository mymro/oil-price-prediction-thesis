Topline: President Trump said in a Twitter thread Saturday night that if Iran strikes any Americans or American assets in retaliation for the death of Qassem Soleimani, “we have targeted 52 Iranian sites,” which he said represents the 52 hostages that were held during the 1979 crisis.           Key background: Soleimani was killed by the U.S. in an early Friday morning air strike at Baghdad’s airport. He was a powerful leader in Iran and had become a celebrity for his role leading the elite Quds Force. Around 1988 Soleimani took command of the organization, which often managed Iran’s clandestine operations abroad, and built a network of allies and proxy forces in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. In April, the U.S. designated the Quds Force as a foreign terrorist organization. The Trump administration and Tehran have been locked in a war of words since Trump scrapped an Obama-era deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program and reimposed sanctions. The U.S. blamed Iran for explosions that rocked two oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz in June, mysterious strikes on a key Saudi Aramco oil facility in September and the death of American contractor in a rocket attack on a Kirkuk military base. After an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday, Trump said Iran was responsible, and the Pentagon said in a statement released after his killing that Soleimani approved the embassy attack .
