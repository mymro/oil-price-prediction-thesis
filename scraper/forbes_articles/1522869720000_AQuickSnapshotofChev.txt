Chevron Corporation generates its revenues from two sources: its upstream business — which includes Crude Oil & Natural Gas Liquid, and the Natural Gas segments — and from its downstream operations. The crude Oil & NGL segment accounts for over 60% of the company’s value, according to our estimates. We have created an interactive dashboard highlighting the company’s Crude Oil & NGL segment. You can adjust revenue drivers and EBITDA margins for 2018 and 2019 to see how it impacts the company’s overall revenues and EBITDA. Below we discuss our expectations and forecasts for the company. What Makes Crude Oil & NGL the Most Valuable Business For Chevron Corporation? While the Crude Oil & NGL segment accounts for over 20% of the company’s overall revenues, its contribution to EBITDA is much higher at 60%, thus making it the most valuable segment for Chevron Corporation. This can be attributed to the fact that downstream operations for any oil & gas company accounts for a significant portion of revenues but only a fraction of that to the overall EBITDA, as the business operates on very low margins, usually in low single digits. For Chevron corporation, the downstream business accounts for over 70% of the company’s revenues, but only 22% to the overall EBITDA.
