As anticipated by the market, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company, posted a strong improvement in its June quarter revenue backed by improved price realization for its upstream operations. However, the company’s earnings dipped due to lower-than-expected upstream production, weaker chemical margins, and unfavorable foreign exchange impact, causing it to miss its earnings expectations. As a result, its stock dropped almost 3% post the announcement of its results. However, we believe that the company’s focus on the Permian Basin and new offshore discoveries in Guyana and Brazil, and LNG opportunities in Mozambique, will drive a large portion of its value in the long term. We currently have a price estimate of $80 per share for Exxon Mobil, which is in line with its market price.
