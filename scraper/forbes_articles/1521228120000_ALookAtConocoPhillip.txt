ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) saw strong growth in revenue in 2017, backed by a rise in volume shipments and commodity price growth. OPEC and non-OPEC allies’ decision to extend production cuts is expected to continue to benefit pricing and, in turn, the company's top line in the coming years. We expect ConocoPhillips' revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 10% over the next two years, largely driven by its crude oil and midstream operations. We have created an interactive dashboard which provides a detailed analysis of our forecasts and estimates for the company. You can make changes to any of the key drivers to arrive at your own estimates and see how changes impact the company's growth forecasts. Near-Term Revenue Growth Likely To Be Moderate ConocoPhillips' crude oil and midstream marketing business is likely to remain a significant revenue driver for the company over the next two years. The company expects its production levels (excluding Libya) to grow by 5% on a year-on-year basis, and has restricted its sustainable capital investment for 2018 to $3.5 billion, which could go up to $5.5 billion based on the pace of its production growth. The targeted production growth could be difficult to achieve with the current capital budget if commodity prices do not recover as the company currently forecasts. As a result of the aforementioned factors, we expect ConocoPhillips to display moderate revenue growth over the span of the next two years. Our interactive model depicts detailed price and volume figures to arrive at the expected revenue figure for 2019. You can easily modify our assumptions to arrive at your own revenue estimates.
