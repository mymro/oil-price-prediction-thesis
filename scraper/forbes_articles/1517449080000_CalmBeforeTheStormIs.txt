You might have been startled by the restraint shown by President Trump on trade-related issues during his State of the Union address this week, or even at Davos. Don't get used to it. When the federal government releases its annual trade data for 2017 on Tuesday, it could very well set off a trade-related Twitter tirade. I hate to provide the administration its talking points, but here is what the data will show: Let me say this about that: And here's a few more talking points for the globalists among you: While tariffs are little more than a tax on consumers to protect a relatively small subset of the American workforce, lower gasoline prices, lower LNG prices, lower heating oil prices, affect almost all Americans positively. If the twitter storm comes on Tuesday, be prepared with your counter-arguments. If it doesn't, well, maybe our president is ready to get on board, ready to revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership as he suggested recently, ready to embrace a slightly updated NAFTA, ready to only tweak the U.S.-South Korea FTA, ready to get back in line with a half century of U.S. precedent in encouraging trade, including multilateral trade agreements. Don't bet on it, though.
