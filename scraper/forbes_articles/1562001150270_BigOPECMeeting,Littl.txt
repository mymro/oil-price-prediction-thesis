The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) met today to decide whether it would continue its current production quotas for an additional 9 months. As of 1 pm ET today, all indications were that OPEC would extend the cuts, but the official OPEC press conference has not happened yet. Oil prices are up, but the increase seems to have more to do with the semi-positive outcome of the President Trump and President Xi's meeting after the G-20 summit. Equities markets in the United States also reacted positively to the news that China and the U.S. planned to resume trade talks. WTI hit $60 per barrel earlier in the day when the Saudi energy minister, Khalid al Falih, announced that the delegates were almost all in agreement that the production agreement should be extended for 9 months, instead of the the traditional 6 months, but prices fell back down below $59 per barrel shortly thereafter. OPEC does not seem to be able to impact oil prices in a significant way this summer. There are several reasons for this: Tomorrow, Russia and the other non-OPEC countries will meet with OPEC to confirm if they will continue with the production cuts for the additional 9 months.
