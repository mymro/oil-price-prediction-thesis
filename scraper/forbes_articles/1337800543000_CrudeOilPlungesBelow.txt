For the first time since last October, crude oil futures are trading below $90 per barrel. Light Sweet Crude Oil (WTI) for July delivery was down $2.27 to $89.58 per barrel in NYMEX trading just after 1:00 p.m. in New York, but had recovered above the $90 mark to $90.27 by 3:00 p.m. Crude has fallen hard from $106 per barrel at the beginning of May. Putting pressure on oil prices is the new round of uncertainty in Europe, as Greece teeters on the brink of membership in the European monetary union and other heavily indebted countries like Spain and Italy wrestle with their impending fiscal pickles. The fear is that Europe's continued chaos will drag down global economic growth for the remainder of 2012 and possibly into 2013. Also weighing on oil are ongoing talks between Iran and the International Atomic Energy, as well as six world powers--United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, Germany--about a compromise on Iran's nuclear program. The talks have at least temporarily dissipated the likelihood of an attack by the United States or Israel on Iran's nuclear facilities. Also noteworthy was a government report showing U.S. crude oil inventories higher than expected in the past month. The shaky situation in Europe has sent the euro down to a new low for the year against the dollar. Strength in the U.S. dollar has exacerbated the plunge in oil and other commodities. So far in May, the U.S. dollar index, tracked by the UUP ETF, is up 3.71%, while the euro, tracked by the FXE, is down 4.21%. Gold and silver have been hammered but not as badly as oil, down 13% for the month. The SPDR Select Energy (XLE) ETF was down 1.8% Wednesday, with exploration and production companies like Anadarko down 2.7% but integrated oil companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron faring better with declines of less than 1.5%.
