In the early morning hours of June 13, two shipping tankers in the Gulf of Oman were attacked and sustained major damage. Both tankers caught fire around 6 am local time and their crews were evacuated. One ship is owned by a Norwegian company and the other is owned by a Japanese company. Both were carrying petrochemical products bound for Asia. These new attacks come exactly a month after four tankers sustained minor damage from explosions of what were probably limpet mines in the Persian Gulf. Oil prices jumped on news of the tanker explosions. Both Brent and WTI rose as much as 4% before retreating. Though this price jump may seem significant, it is actually less than the drop in oil prices seen just the day before, when prices fell based on new oil supply numbers from the EIA showing higher oil inventories in the United States. The market continues to be so concerned about a potential drop in demand that even possible military conflict in the Persian Gulf caused by incidents directly impacting oil products is not enough to shock the market. Many are blaming Iran for the attacks. It would be curious timing on Iran's part since the attack involved a Japanese-owned ship and it comes during a visit to Tehran by the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe. But in 1898, an American warship, the USS Maine, exploded in Havana Harbor, precipitating a long-anticipated war between the United States and Spain. The war was deadly and had major consequences to the U.S., Spain, the Philippines, the Caribbean and other. Yet, 78 years later, the U.S. Navy determined that the explosion on the Maine was likely caused by internal problems, not sabotage. The lesson is that is it important to be cautious when war is a possibility.
