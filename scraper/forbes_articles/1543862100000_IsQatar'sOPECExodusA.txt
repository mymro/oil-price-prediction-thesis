Qatar's announcement that it plans to leave OPEC in January 2019, could foreshadow a major setback for Saudi Arabia. On its own, the decision seems unimportant. After all, Qatar is not a major oil producer. However, coupled with recent statements from Iran -- another OPEC country allied with Qatar against Saudi Arabia -- there may be signs of a revolt against Saudi dominance of the cartel . For Qatar, membership in OPEC does not provide many benefits. It is a minor oil producer (although Qatar actually exports a significant amount of liquified natural gas) and has little influence on the decisions of OPEC. Qatar gains nothing by subjecting itself to the dictates of Saudi Arabia within the OPEC organization. Moreover, there may also be a domestic political benefit for the government in standing up to Saudi Arabia in front of the Qatari people. This could be seen as a jab at Saudi Arabia, although OPEC will not feel the loss of a 600,000 barrel per day oil producer. This is less than 2% of total OPEC production.    But if Qatar's decision is the beginning of more discontent among smaller oil producers towards the dominance of Saudi Arabia and its new partner, Russia, then this could herald big problems for the cartel and Saudi Arabia's position as a market mover. Iran is a significant oil producer, but its OPEC governor warned today that “With [Saudi Arabia's and Russia's] behavior, for small producers there is no merit to stay in OPEC.” OPEC meets on Thursday December 6 in Vienna for its biannual meeting. If the smaller producers are now emboldened to stand up to Saudi Arabia and its close ally, the UAE, then the oil market could be in for more instability and uncertainty.
