Everybody knows about the great U.S. oil boom since 2008, where we have provided the vast majority of new non-OPEC oil. Looking forward, however, Canada and Brazil will join us in greatly expanding that essential supply stock The U.S. Department of Energy just released International Energy 2019 is particularly bullish on new crude coming from Canada. In fact, Canada is expected to account for almost 25% of new crude oil globally through 2050. This is noteworthy because Canada's main production zone Alberta has been forced to install cuts because prices had gotten so low from a lack of midstream infrastructure to move supply. New pipeline projects in Canada have faced delays related to environmental and regulatory impediments as well as political opposition. For example, a decade ago, the average price differential between Western Canada Select and West Texas Intermediate was around 15% of the WTI price. Last year, this had reached 40-45% during the first quarter, which resulted in Albertaâ€™s oil curtailment forced by Premier Rachel Notley. There remains uncertainty when new pipelines can be expected, such as the Trans Mountain expansion and Enbridge's Line 3 project. "Feds idle as pipeline obstructionists wage war." The Canadian federal election is set for October 21, with the delicate dance of climate change versus oil and gas development at the forefront for PM Justin Trudeau.
