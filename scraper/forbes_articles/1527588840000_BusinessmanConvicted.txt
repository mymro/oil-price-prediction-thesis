Above The Law had a good piece on the reasons why someone would be their own defense counsel in a criminal case; 1) They think they know more about the case than their lawyer, 2) They cannot afford a lawyer (or the lawyer they want) and 3) They're insane. In a complex case in the Southern District of New York, defendant Raheem Brennerman has decided to be his own defense counsel in two separate cases in front of two very high profile judges (U.S. District Judges Lewis Kaplan and Richard Sullivan). Brennerman, who is currently being held in Brooklyn MDC, has been on one hellacious legal journey. On April 19, 2017, Brennerman woke up at 2:00am to work from his apartment at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Residences in Las Vegas. He had spent the previous day putting together a business deal with Exotix Partners to sell 20% of Blacksands Pacific Nigeria, a company he headed with options for extensive crude oil rights in Nigeria. The buyer of the crude oil was BP Oil. For Brennerman, it would mean tens of millions of dollars in his pocket. Brennerman worked for a few hours, then napped before working the rest of the day. At 6:00am there was series of rapid bangs at his door. Startled, he jumped to answer and there were eight U.S. Attorney criminal investigative agents from the Southern District of New York standing in blue windbreaker jackets. The agent nearest him said, "We have a warrant for your arrest." The group rushed in, hand cuffed Brennerman and sat him down on one of his dining room chairs. In shock Brennerman asked, "What is this about?" He had been arrested on contempt of court charges and was then taken to a federal government office in Las Vegas.
