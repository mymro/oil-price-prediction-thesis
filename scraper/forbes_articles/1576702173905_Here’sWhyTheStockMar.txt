Updated 10:30 a.m. EST, 12/19/20 Topline: With the House of Representatives voting in favor of impeaching President Donald Trump on Wednesday evening, the stock market has largely trended flat, with little movement to either the upside or downside. Here’s how the markets are reacting and what investors can expect in the next few weeks:   Crucial quotes: “As far as impeachment concerns go, obviously presidents can make their presence felt on the economy, but in the long run ‘it’s the economy stupid,’” says Hickey. “Despite the frenzy, it’s an open question whether we should care. As citizens, we certainly should. As investors—no,” says McMillan. “It makes sense that the markets have not been derailed by the impeachment process.” What to watch for: “If there was a bigger risk that Trump would be removed from office, with one or two Senate Republicans defecting, that could spark a bit more anxiety in the markets,” says Crisafulli. Similarly, if impeachment drags on and creates political turmoil, that could hurt investor confidence in the economy and markets, says McMIllan. “If political dysfunction—and this risk isn’t limited to impeachment—shakes confidence, it could take a toll on the bigger economic picture.”
