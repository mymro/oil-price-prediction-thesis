Over the past three days, representatives from OPEC+ (meaning OPEC along with its non-organization partners such as Russia, Mexico and Bahrain) met in Vienna to discuss a potential production cut in response to the Coronavirus. The outbreak in China has put downward pressure on the price of oil, because traders see a drop in Chinese demand and fear a greater global economic slowdown. This meeting was convened as an emergency response, and it was clear that certain OPEC members were hoping to stabilize oil prices. However, the meeting proved once again that the oil cartel is hamstrung by its new partners—Russia in particular. OPEC operates by consensus, meaning all members must agree in order for the group to cut or increase production. In reality, the powerful countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates often compel the others to go along with policy. Since the end of 2016, OPEC has invited these non-OPEC partners to participate in decision-making, in effect putting them in a position to grant final approval (or disapproval) of OPEC policy. As the most powerful country and biggest producer among the non-OPEC partners, Russia can now say nyet to OPEC policy. That seems to be what happened this morning, and, as a result, the market did not provide the bounce OPEC was hoping for. OPEC had hoped to announce that its Joint Technical Committee was recommending a production cut of 600,000 barrels per day, which the cartel expected would raise and stabilize the price of oil. But soon after the meeting ended, reports started coming in that Russia did not approve. As a result, the international oil benchmark, Brent, refused to rise. Russia has its own reasons for keeping production at current levels—mostly because its oil companies and government need the revenue. OPEC+ may take up this issue again in March, when it is scheduled to hold a full ministerial meeting, but, for now, this is a strong reminder that OPEC isn’t really in charge right now. Russia is.
