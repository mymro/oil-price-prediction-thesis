(Updated: 2:17 PM) Topline: Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said Thursday it seized a foreign oil tanker in the Persian Gulf (and then released a video as proof), driving up oil prices and further escalating regional tensions, especially following two tanker attacks occurring off the country’s coast since May and a cessation of diplomacy between the U.S. and Iran. Key background: Since the Trump administration withdrew the U.S. in 2018 from an international Obama-era agreement designed to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran, the Middle Eastern country has been involved with or blamed for various incidents in the region. In May and June, two different oil tanker attacks occurred off Iran’s coast. Iran denied involvement, but the U.S. blamed Iran for both incidents. Escalating tensions between the two countries—including Iran downing a U.S. Navy drone—led Iran to end all diplomacy with the U.S. Iran announced this month it exceeded the limit of enriched uranium as stipulated in the nuclear agreement after additional penalties were imposed following the tanker and drone incidents. What to watch for: Responses from President Trump, secretary of state Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, or Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif. All have been vocal (especially on Twitter) about affairs between the U.S. and Iran.
