Topline: Iran claims Monday it arrested 17 spies working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)—and that some of those 17 were sentenced to death—while President Trump tweeted the claim “is totally false.” Key background: More broadly, Monday’s announcement is the latest in a very tense standoff between Iran and the West. Just over two weeks ago, British forces captured an Iranian oil tanker off the coast of Gibraltar and reported that they chased away Iranian vessels attempting to capture one of their tankers in retaliation. The U.K. suspected the Iranian tanker was bound for Syria, according to the BBC. And since the U.S. withdrew from Iran nuclear deal, tensions have steadily escalated. In May and June, two different oil tanker attacks occurred off Iran’s coast. Iran denied involvement, but the U.S. blamed the nation for both incidents. When Iran downed a U.S. Navy drone in June, the incident led to Iran severing diplomatic ties with America. Iran announced this month that it exceeded the limit of enriched uranium in the Obama-era nuclear deal but insisted it would use the material for peaceful purposes only, according to the New York Times.
