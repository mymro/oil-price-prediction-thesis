Honeywell International (NYSE: HON) posted rather stellar results this time around. The conglomerate easily surpassed both the sales and earnings estimates expected by analysts in the quarter. In general, the top line improved greatly on a strong performance at aerospace. This improved performance consequently gave the company enough confidence to raise its earnings guidance for a second time this year. The industrial giant now expects 2018 profit of $7.85 to $8.05 per share, compared with previous forecast of $7.75-$8.00, while revenues come in around $42.7 billion-$43.5 billion, from the previously forecast $41.8 billion-$42.5 billion.
