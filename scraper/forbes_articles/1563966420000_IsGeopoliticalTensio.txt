The crude oil price has traded mostly in the range of $51- 61 for the past two months and for the fourth consecutive day, the price has been trading in an upward direction. The recent momentum in the oil price is due to two main reasons. Firstly, it is due to the drop in the U.S. crude oil inventory data, which has made investors believe that the supply is well managed and the chances of oil glut forming again are minuscule. Secondly, there is optimism about face to face trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. Remember, demand always plays an important role . If it is strong, it can take care of extra supply, but if there is a weakness, even a small supply can start to look like a glut. So, the question is what is the impact of heightened geopolitical tension? Well, the answer is in the forward contracts. We need to focus on the gap between Brent crude’s front-month and the following month (second month) contracts. Currently, this gap is 8c/bbl. In simple terms, the backwardation of the curve is the smallest since March. The below chart shows the spread between the current month and forward month for Brent crude, and it is no way closer to the levels which we experienced in late December last year when Trump started to cause disruptions in the Middle East.    In addition to this, we also have the International Monetary Fund who didn’t quite paint an optimistic picture by notching down the global growth forecast from its previous estimates. As for the speculators’ positions, the CFTC and ICE data show that there was an increase in the bearish percentage, the bullish sentiment dropped by -0.4% and overall net short positions increased by -7784. The chart below shows the total net long and net short positions. To conclude, it looks like traders are less worried about the geopolitical tensions and more focused on the supply data and the ongoing trade negotiations between China and the U.S.
