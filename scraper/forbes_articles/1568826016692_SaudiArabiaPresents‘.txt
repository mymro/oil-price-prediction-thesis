Topline: Saudi Arabia has presented what it says is evidence that rival Iran was behind crippling missile attacks on two of its major Aramco oil plants, as President Donald Trump, who previously said the U.S. was “locked and loaded” to respond to the culprits, moved to ramp up sanctions on Tehran.         What to watch for: Pompeo’s response. He is expected to give a speech in Jeddah later on Wednesday after meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss the strikes. Key background: Wednesday’s presentation will certainly worsen Tehran’s already dire relationship with Washington, not to mention with Riyadh. As mentioned, Trump said he has already moved to intensify sanctions on Iran, notching up the “maximum pressure” strategy his administration has employed since pulling out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal last year.  The Houthis, who seized control of much of Yemen in 2015, have been at war with a Western-backed Saudi-led coalition that has been trying to oust them from the region ever since. Iran has previously backed the Houthis but has denied arming them. Tangent: In an unexpected boon for Donald Trump, China, the world’s largest oil importer, is now turning to the U.S. for its supply of light crude, despite Beijing slapping a 5% tariff on American oil imports beginning on September 1.
