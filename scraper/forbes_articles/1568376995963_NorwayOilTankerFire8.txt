The oil tanker “Dubai Harmony” suffered a fire during refuelling at the Sture terminal in western Norway on the morning of September 13. The fire is now out and no injuries have been reported, according to the fire department. 80 people were evacuated as a precautionary measure from the terminal, which is run by the Norwegian multinational energy company Equnior, formerly known as Statoil. The 820-feet-long Dubai Harmony is a Liberian-owned oil tanker, built in 2005. There were 23 people aboard, all of whom have been accounted for. However, regional police operations manager Morten Rebnord said that one person is being assessed by medics for smoke inhalation. The alarm was raised at approximately 11am when smoke was spotted in the engine room during a routine refuelling. Fire trucks and boats were immediately sent from Bergen, with sea rescue vessels providing additional support. The fire service reported that the fire had been completely extinguished just after 1pm. “A total of 102 people were at the terminal when the situation arose. Everyone, except 22 people on standby, has been evacuated from the terminal, said Equinor spokesman Eskil Eriksen. It is not yet known how much oil the tanker was carrying. Equinor’s Sture terminal is a major part of the Norwegian oil and gas industry’s infrastructure. Petoro AS, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil also have ownership stakes. From Sture, crude oil and LPG is shipped out around the globe. It is one of five such terminals in Norway and employs 200 people. The terminal receives crude oil and condensate from the Oseberg field and crude oil from the Grane field through undersea pipelines. A volatile gas recovery (VOC) plant and a process plant that recycles the lightest components from the crude oil are also located at the facility, which receives around 120 oil and LPG tankers each year. This number is set to increase when the Edvard Grieg and Ivar Aasen fields are connected to the terminal.
