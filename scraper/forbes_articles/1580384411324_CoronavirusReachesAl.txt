Topline: The coronavirus outbreak that began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has now spread to all regions in the country, with at least 170 people dead and nearly 8,000 infected worldwide—mostly in China.   Evacuations in numbers:   What to watch for: The World Health Organization will decide whether to declare a global health emergency on Thursday, while Hong Kong will enforce a ban on high-speed rail and ferry travel to and from mainland China beginning Thursday.  Additional fact: More businesses are shuttering stores in China. Ikea has temporarily closed its 30 sites in the mainland, in addition to Starbucks, McDonald’s, KFC and Pizza Hut, while employees of Amazon and Facebook in China have been told to work from home. Many provinces have advised nonessential businesses to remain closed until the week after next, while the Lunar New Year holiday ends this Sunday. Ongoing travel and lockdown restrictions are likely to hamper a return to normal routines. Key background: The first case of 2019-nCoV was reported in December. Chinese authorities say the disease broke out in a seafood market in Wuhan, transmitted from an animal, and now being transmitted between humans. The disease remains a mystery to health experts, but is spread through airborne droplets from coughing and sneezing. Symptoms range from coughing and sneezing to pneumonia and kidney failure in the severest cases; the incubation period is up to 14 days. This week, Australian scientists created the virus in a lab, which could be used to speed up the development of a vaccine and develop a better understanding of the virus.
