ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), one of the largest independent oil and gas companies, posted a remarkable improvement in its third quarter financial results last week. The company exceeded the market expectations on both the revenue and earnings front on the back of notably higher price realizations and production during the quarter. Further, the company’s profitability has also improved due to higher revenue as well as lower interest expenses. However, the key highlight of the quarter was the 7% increase in the company’s quarterly dividend. The move shows ConocoPhillips’ willingness to share its growth with its shareholders, which has reinforced investor confidence in the company. Consequently, the stock has gained 4.2% since the announcement of results and is currently trading at $68.48 per share. We expect the company’s focus on its key basins, Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Delaware, coupled with the rising commodity prices to drive its value in the long term. We currently have a price estimate of $71 per share for ConocoPhillips, which is higher than its market price.
