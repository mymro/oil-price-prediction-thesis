Topline: Despite uncertainty around the U.S. economic outlook and disagreements over the direction of future monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is still widely expected to cut interest rates to a range of 1.75% to 2% on Wednesday. Key background: While positive trade news helped boost the market near record highs last week, stocks fell again after a weekend attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities caused a spike in global oil prices. A great deal of investor uncertainty remains, primarily over mixed U.S. economic data (manufacturing is contracting and inflation remains low even as consumer spending and employment levels stay strong), ongoing geopolitical risks like the trade war with China, and the yield curve. All eyes will be on the Fed as the market looks for guidance.
