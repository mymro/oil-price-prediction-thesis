Last night, during the first half of the Democrat's first presidential debate, the candidates spoke about climate change and energyâ€”but only vaguely. The candidates avoided serious policy plans. Even Senator Elizabeth Warren, who called for some unknown amount of money to be spent on research for "green products," lacked real details. And the moderators did not press for details. Perhaps it was hard to get into the substance with so many candidates on stage vying for time, but at some point they need to elucidate their ideas if only to distinguish themselves from the pack. Here are questions Democrat candidates should be asked tonight in the second half of the debate and all the way through the campaign: Concerning the future of power generation and fuel in America, candidates should be pressed to detail specifics. After all, the last couple of presidents have shown that executive power is exceedingly influential in determining US energy policy. Concerning global oil policy, candidates should be pressed on the intersection of climate or energy issues with geopolitics. The candidates should also be pressed on their own personal energy use and the practices of their campaigns.
