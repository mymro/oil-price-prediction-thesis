Anadarko Petroleum is giving strong buy signals. First, the overall market is highly likely to be higher one year from now. I expect the technology and the financial sectors to continue to be leaders. The biggest turnaround is likely to be the energy sector. The stocks had been lagging the oil price and the S&P until recently. It is one of the few sectors that are not overbought. Below, we see the monthly graph of the XLE energy sector ETF. In the first strip, we see a breakout from a 4-year trading range. In the second strip, there are higher lows in momentum, a telltale sign of a developing uptrend. Third, we see an upturn in relative strength versus the S&P 500. Let me add that many of the stocks are much stronger than the XLE in relative terms, as is Anadarko. XLE-Monthly is Beginning a Bull Trend The monthly graph of APC is below. The stock broke through the absolute and the relative downtrend lines. There are higher lows in momentum, a constructive development. The $71-$72 area is a reasonable first objective. APC-Monthly The cycles are supportive of higher prices. The first is the static cycle in the form of a monthly histogram. It depicts the expected return in each month. Note that the January-March run is the best in any year. Over the last 31 years, APC has actually risen in the month of March 71.6% of the time for an average 5.3% gain.
