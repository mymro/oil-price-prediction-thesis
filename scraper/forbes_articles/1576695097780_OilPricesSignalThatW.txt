For the past year, the greatest influence on the price of oil has been economic anxiety. The price of oil has been kept in check and occasionally depressed because of fears of a global economic slowdown which would hamper oil demand. Therefore, it is meaningful that as the House of Representatives is voting to impeach President Trump, the price of oil is rising ever so slightly. Traders do not see the impeachment as an event that will impact the status quo, meaningfully disrupt the presidency or hurt the economy. For more than a year, sentiment concerning the U.S.-China trade dispute has significantly impacted the price of oil more. Last week, the two countries announced an agreement for a Phase One of a trade deal. The oil markets responded positively, seeing indications that the global economy would prosper and oil demand would rise. Now there are reports that economists believe the U.S. economy will do well through 2020. Typically, one might expect major political turmoil like an impeachment of the president to shake up those good sentiments. But that does not seem to be happening. The markets simply don’t see the impeachment going anywhere. It is clear that the President will not be convicted in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans. The actions of traders today show that they also do not believe that this impeachment will interfere with the President’s agenda, such as pursuing trade deals. Perhaps it helps that the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has agreed to allow the House to approve the USMCA trade deal with Mexico and Canada. In doing that, the Speaker showed that the impeachment will not interfere with economic prosperity. In fact, the price of gold is simultaneously dropping slightly. That indicates that people are not worried about a downturn. It is quite the opposite. Whatever is happening with impeachment on Capitol Hill, the finance world is betting it won’t interfere with their wallets.
