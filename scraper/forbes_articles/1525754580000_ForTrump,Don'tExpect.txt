If President Trump announces today that the United States is pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, without concessions, there will be winners and losers. As for Trump himself, that's a tough one. While it's hard to see how he wins, that's often the case: It's generally hard to see how he wins. Until he does. While an announcement to pull out might simply give all parties time to negotiate additional terms to the deal, there is still risk involved, particularly if Iran is willing to walk away. When I look at the potential winners and losers of a true U.S. withdrawal, it's tough to make pulling out work. Winners: I would add Venezuela to the list but the ravished South American, OPEC-member nation, crumbling under the weight of a humanitarian crisis, might just be too decimated, too far gone, to recover unless oil prices rebound another 40-50 percent. Losers: It's this last "loser" that I believe will drive Trump's decision. It's possible the economy could cruise along, thanks in large part to the short-term benefits of the tax deal alone. It's possible higher oil prices -- and gas prices -- are already "baked in." But, as long as he believes there's a chance to get an agreement to officially end the Korean War, to disarm North Korea, and to put in place systems to effectively monitor compliance, he won't scuttle the Iran deal. There's a Nobel Peace Prize at the end of that rainbow, even if it would need to be shared and even if it takes some time. For Trump, it would offer vindication. It would, at least momentarily, silence his highly vocal critics and doubters who would begrudgingly be forced to acknowledge a significant success that had eluded his 11 predecessors. While a credible peace deal could elude him, remember, if nothing else, Trump's a gambler and he just might like his odds.
