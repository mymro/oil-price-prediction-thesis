Topline: Amid worries that spiking oil prices will impact the global economy, the U.S. stock market declined on Monday morning—although a rally in gold and in sectors like energy and defense could provide investors with a respite. Key Background: Following a weekend attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities that effectively knocked out 5% of the world’s supply, oil prices rose 11%—and had earlier surged as much as 20%, adding to Wall Street uncertainty. Looking Ahead: The biggest piece of news for investors this week remains the Federal Reserve meeting, with markets already pricing in another expected quarter point interest-rate cut. President Trump again criticized the Fed in a pair of tweets on Monday, arguing for a lower interest rate in the wake of the Saudi oil news.
