On Wednesday, Fed Chair Powell spoke in New York City and sounded slightly less hawkish than he has been. Part of his less hawkish view is a direct result of the weaker than expected global data of late and concerns that tariffs and trade wars are impacting the global economy. Anyone who views oil prices as a barometer of global activity needs to be concerned as Brent Crude prices have dropped from over $85 in October ton under $60 as of Tuesday's close. Domestically, the auto industry and housing have been suffering of late. XHB, a homebuilder ETF is down almost 19% year to date. Powell had two messages that I took away from his speech While Powell has seemed to go out of his way to avoid creating the 'Fed Put' that predecessors seem to have established, I believe that he must have looked at recent credit market weakness and financial conditions tightening and decided that while he isn't there to protect equity valuations, he shouldn't let credit concerns percolate too quickly. Yes, President Trump has tweeted and spoken about his negative view on Powell's track record, but I believe this was a rational reaction to the economic data, to increased concerns about how balance sheet reduction is impacting bond markets, and possibly to listening to a wider range of input from other Fed board members. I think sounding less hawkish is the right move. He will still hike if the data warrants it, but he sounded less dogmatic about it. I expect to hear over the coming weeks that the Fed will decide to leave their balance sheet larger than previously estimated by Wall Street, which would bring Quantitative Tightening to a close sooner than expected. This combination of balance sheet reduction with rate hikes is new and they should be very cautious about creating negative imbalances, especially when global growth seems to be dissipating.
