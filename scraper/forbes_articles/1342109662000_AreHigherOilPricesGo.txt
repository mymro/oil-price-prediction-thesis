The chart watchers over at brokerage firm Auerbach Grayson say that oil is in an "all out bull mode" despite Thursday's fall below $100 in London. "Our macro technical analysis continues to suggest that the summer advance in risky assets which commenced in June remains broadly intact, and we continue to be tactical buyers of commodities, global equities...and crude," said Richard Ross, a Chartered Market Technician and Global Technical Strategist at Auerbach Grayson. "Crude remains one of our favorite charts and a cornerstone of our bullish call," Ross wrote in a chart-filled note to clients on Wednesday. Analysts often equate crude oil price with risk appetite. When oil prices are rising, it is either because large economies are buying oil or speculators believe they will be doing so soon and thus forcing prices higher on perceived demand jumps. Although Brent crude oil prices are correcting, down under $100 a barrel again on Thursday to around $98.97, Brent crude was at $111.00 dollar per barrel in 2011 and $109.00 per barrel oil on average in 2012. Joseph E. Meyer, a securities arbitrator in Florida and publisher of the contrarian Straight Money Analysis newsletter, said that oil demand is dependent on emerging Asia. "We are in a foot race with China and India to secure the natural resources of the world. The emerging markets will continue to build out their infrastructures over the next decade, and will put tremendous pressure on energy resources and all essential commodities, so for those reasons and more I continue to view oil as a long-term bullish sector of the market," he said, adding, "It is a core holding in any long-term portfolio." On Thursday, the iPath S&P Crude Oil Total Return (OIL) exchange traded fund was down 1.09 percent to $20.84 per share. The ETF is 17 percent year to date.
