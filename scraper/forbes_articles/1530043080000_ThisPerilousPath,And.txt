Three forces are converging in an unfortunate way. Ironically, that might lead to President Trump claiming victory, or at least progress, in his efforts to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. He might even start doing it soon, since we are leading up to mid-term elections that are critical to the second half of his first term in office. If Democrats retake the House or the Senate, or both, that will not be good news for the president. While I am less concerned about deficits than those whispering in Trump's ear and the many Americans, many of whom support the president and many who don't, who are also instinctively opposed to deficits, here are those three: While we currently have strong growth and ridiculously low unemployment in this country, here is a possible outcome to the above: Imports fall, thanks to the tariffs. The value of exports increases as oil, gasoline and natural gas exploration become more profitable, thanks to higher prices. That leads to a shrinking trade deficit. Mission accomplished, or being accomplished. Trump declares success in his efforts to reduce the deficit, and we get to see what that looks like. Higher prices for almost everything we buy after a decade of living with virtually nonexistent inflation, including gasoline, food, clothing, housing, cars and all sorts of electronics. Higher unemployment, after getting accustomed to the unemployment rate falling for a decade. It is the very definition of a Pyrrhic victory.
