Transocean (NYSE:RIG), the largest offshore driller, faced significant headwinds over the last 4 years as the downturn in the oil market reduced demand for high-cost, long-lifecycle offshore projects. Over the last several quarters, the company has been upgrading its fleet to focus on the more lucrative harsh-environment and high-specification ultra-deepwater rigs, via the acquisition of Songa Offshore and Ocean Rig. While contracting activity has improved in the ultra-deepwater space, with about 66 rigs working in May, up from about 57 at the end of last year per Bassoe Offshore, the pricing environment has remained subdued as the market remains oversupplied. In this analysis, we take a look at how Transocean’s key operating metrics are expected to trend in the near-term and how it could impact the company’s bottom line.
