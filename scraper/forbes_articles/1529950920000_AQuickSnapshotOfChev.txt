Chevron Corporation’s (NYSE:CVX) Natural Gas business accounts for 14% of the company’s value, according to our estimates. Natural gas price movement is closely related to that of crude oil prices. As such, the average natural gas price realization for Chevron was lower in 2015 and 2016. However, a recovery in oil prices since the second half of 2017 led to better price realization in the recent quarters, and this has aided the segment growth. However, natural gas prices are trading lower in 2018, as compared to the 2017 average. This can be attributed to higher production, which stood at 73.6 bcf (billion cubic feet) per day in 2017, and is expected to average 81.2 bcf per day in 2018. As such, we expect a low single digit segment revenue decline in 2018. We have created an interactive dashboard analysis highlighting the company’s Natural Gas business. You can adjust revenue drivers and margins for 2018 and 2019 to see how it impacts the company’s overall revenues, earnings, and price estimate. Below we discuss our expectations and forecasts for the segment. Expect Natural Gas Price Realization To Trend Lower In 2018
