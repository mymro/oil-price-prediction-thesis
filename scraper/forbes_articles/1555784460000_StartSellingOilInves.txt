The last (March 17) posting regarding the oil price indicated that there would be a high in late April. Black gold is at a high in the last week of April according to cycles-based research. The first graphic below shows that oil is overbought weekly having more than doubled from the January 2016 low. Chart 1 As we can see below, oil has passed the most bullish season of the year. Chart 2-Oil Price Annual Histogram (from 1983) Below is the daily histogram of expected price for the month of May. As we can see from these seasonal graphs oil is sailing into a headwind. Chart 3- Daily Histogram for Oil for May Both the weekly and the monthly cycles point down. Chart 4- Weekly Oil Cycle Chart 5- Monthly Cycle The bearish factors are: The annual high for any April is on the 22nd. The high for the monthly cycle is on the 27th and the weekly cycle high is on April 20th. So, the high for this price rise will likely be between the 20th and the 29th. Following that time period, we will likely see the largest oil decline in 2019. The Q4 2018 decline may have been an A wave down and the current rally a B wave up. The post-April decline projected by the monthly cycle may be a C wave, the most severe in an A-B-C sequence. If this is true, then the drop could take oil back to the old 2016 low near $26.
