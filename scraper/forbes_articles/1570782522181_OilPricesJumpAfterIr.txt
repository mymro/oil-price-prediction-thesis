Topline: An Iranian oil tanker was struck by two missiles 60 miles off the coast of Saudi Arabia on Friday, the National Iranian Oil Company, which owns the vessel, was reported by state media as saying. Oil prices jumped 2%. Key background: The explosion comes less than a month after two major Saudi oil plants were struck on September 14, knocking offline 5% of global oil supply. Production has since been restored. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for the attack, despite Yemenâ€™s Houthi rebels, who are battling a Saudi-led coalition in the country, claiming responsibility. Iran denied it was behind the September strikes. What to watch for: Responses from Saudi Arabia and the U.S. The U.S. blamed Iran for two attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz in May and June. The two nations have been at loggerheads since Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Obama-era nuclear deal and imposed a series of stringent sanction on Tehran over concerns it continued work on its nuclear weapons program.
