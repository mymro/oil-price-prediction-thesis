In an exclusive interview with Recode's editor-at-large Kara Swisher, Tesla CEO Elon Musk suggested that Ford will go bankrupt in the next recession like Chrysler and GM did in the last one, despite a strong base of customers and thousands of dealers. I am reaching out to Ford for a comment and will update this post when I receive a response. Story updated (11/7) with Ford comments    Although Ford chose not to respond to Musk's comments, the Dearborn, Michigan-based carmaker did provide some context to why they didn't feel the need to. "Based on our third-quarter earnings, we have $23.7 billion in cash and $34.7 billion of total liquidity (including credit lines)," told me a Ford spokesperson. "And we’re committed to the regular dividend through the cycle even through an economic downturn as noted in our earnings report found here on slide 11." Atherton Research's Take As Musk mentioned, the history of American car companies is terrible: The only ones that haven’t gone bankrupt are Tesla and Ford. GM and Chrysler, now owned by Italian car company Fiat, are currently riding high on sales of large vehicles (trucks and SUVs), which might not last much longer as a result of higher oil prices and tariffs that will negatively impact earnings. While it's trivial to start a car company, it's insanely difficult to make it successful, to paraphrase Musk as would be "Tesla killers" like electric car startups Faraday Future, Karma Automotive, and Lucid Motors are finding it out the hard way.
