Watch Video Libby Toudouze, Portfolio Manager, Cushing Asset Management speaks with Julie Cooling, Founder & CEO, RIA Channel on the growth and outlook of U.S. energy infrastructure markets, MLPs, and opportunities for 2018. With over $4 billion in assets under management, Cushingâ€™s active, concentrated, MLP investment strategy has clearly gained the attention of the advisory market. Though the past two years have been quite challenging for energy markets, energy infrastructure assets continue to benefit from proposed fiscal policies, and heightened demand for midstream energy plays. Companies that assist with refining crude oil, distribution, pipes and pipe manufacturers, fittings, cargo ships and basic infrastructure investments will win. Some say the U.S. industrial and manufacturing renaissance will continue based on supply and demand factors. From an investment standpoint, attractive yields and strong fundamentals offer investment opportunities across the energy value chain.
