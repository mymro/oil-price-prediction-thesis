Gold has been one of the best performing commodities in recent months. Gold Prices have increased by about 16% over the last one year to over $1,420 per ounce in July 2019, whereas the increase has been close to 20% since its recent low in September 2018. Notwithstanding the adverse impact of the US-China trade war, the increase in gold price is led by increased buying from major central banks and higher retail participation in the face of rising economic uncertainty. However, gold has had its fair share of volatility in the last 50 years, as well.
