Yes, you read the headline correctly. Let me document. A special thanks here to the Paris-based International Energy Agency for its Global Energy & CO2 Status Report 2018. IEA puts out some really great free and for sale reports for us that we should all appreciate. IEA IS the global authority on energy markets and we thank them for such support. What an amazing year for energy in 2018! Let's touch on some critical points and of course some of my commentary. True to form, I must use at least one graphic, this time lifted from IEA's report.    Demand. Global energy demand grew by 2.3% in 2018, twice the annual growth seen since 2010. This was driven by “robust global economy as well as higher heating and cooling needs in some parts of the world. I told you about this years ago, "Global Warming," More Air Conditioning, and More Energy.” Electricity demand rose by 4%, its fastest pace since 2010. Given that electricity is the sine qua non of a modern society, use can only increase: 85% of the global population lives in still developing nations, with consumption at levels we were at in the 1930s. Some 600 million sub-Saharan Africans have no electricity whatsoever, now an afterthought to a western world demanding that they use less. Oil. The U.S. actually led the world in new oil demand in 2018, up 540,000 b/d China was second at a gain of 445,000 b/d, or 3.5%. Despite a slowdown, China still sold a whopping 27 million oil cars in 2018. Electric car sales, meanwhile, more than doubled for the year to over 1.2 million. But, I would argue that these should really be called “coal cars:” coal supplies 65% of China’s electricity, and the country’s young, huge, and efficient fleet will be around a lot longer than opponents want you to know. Together, the U.S. and China account for 35% of global oil demand, which explains why their trade war is so impactful for oil prices.   Natural Gas. Global gas consumption grew by 4.6% in 2018, its largest rise since 2010. The U.S. led this global gas growth, with demand jumping 7.8 Bcf/d , up 10.5% from the previous year and its highest increase since the early-1950s. China was second with a 4.3 Bcf/d gain, or 17%. Up from 2.7% a decade ago, China now accounts for 7.5% of total global gas consumption. Emitting less greenhouse gases and backing up intermittent wind and solar, the global “dash to gas” continues apace. Global gas demand is up 22% since 2010 alone, well above the 13% and 5% increases for oil and coal, respectively. Coal. Global coal demand grew for a second straight year in 2018. Yet, the 0.7% increase was much slower than the 4.5% annual rate seen from 2000 to 2010. Coal is still the world’s second most vital fuel (after oil), and the most important source of electricity, at ~40% of total generation. China and India account for 65% of the world’s coal consumption, with respective demand increases of 1% and 9% in 2018. Renewables. Renewables grew by 4% in 2018, 25% of all new energy demand. Electricity was the centerpiece and renewable power climbed at its best rate this decade. Solar, hydropower, and wind each added 33% of the growth. Renewables covered almost 45% of the world's growth in power generation in 2018 and now account for over 25% of all output. BNEF reports that global investment in wind in 2018 rose 3% to $129 billion, while solar fell 24% to $131 billion. Efficiency. Energy efficiency continued to improve, with global energy intensity dropping 1.3% in 2018. Although this was the third straight year where gains slowed, efficiency is still the biggest source of CO2 emissions abatement. Energy efficiency is a complex concept in that at some point incremental gains become harder (e.g., after the “low hanging fruit” gets picked first). And hugely energy-deprived countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and others require growth strategies that depend on “more energy,” not less. Simply put, conserving into growth is not a practical solution for the horrific depths of poverty that these governments confront. CO2. Global energy-related CO2 emissions grew 1.7% in 2018 to reach a record high of 33.1 Gt, the highest annual increase since 2013. “The increase in emissions was driven by higher energy consumption resulting from a robust global economy.” This is very important because economic growth is an inherent goal of every nation (is it not?). And given the abject poverty in the world, the upside for more energy is very strong, obviously even for the fossil fuels that supply 85% of the world’s energy supply and are required inputs for almost everything we do. Former U.S. Energy Secretary Moniz therefore nails it with his “Green Real Deal” that stresses technological evolution to lower emissions, not favoring particular sources and/or harmful regulations: “More Coal, Oil, and Natural Gas Sanctions Carbon Capture and Storage.” U.S. Contrary to what some keep telling you, the U.S. has been the world’s best CO2 reduction story. Emissions in the world’s largest economy have remarkably remained around their 1990 levels, despite adding nearly 80 million people and $9 trillion in real GDP since then. U.S. CO2 is down 14% and 800 Mt from their peak in 2000. This is the largest absolute reduction among all nations over that time. China, for instance, now has CO2 emissions that are 85% higher than those in the U.S. Again, pretty amazing in that we led the world in new oil and gas demand in 2018!
