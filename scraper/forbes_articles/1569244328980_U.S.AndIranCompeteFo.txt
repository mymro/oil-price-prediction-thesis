Topline: The U.S. and Iran face off during this week’s UN General Assembly, as both countries separately seek support from other world leaders in managing escalating conflict in the Persian Gulf. What to watch for: The outcome of the three-day UN summit. Trump’s meeting schedule is subject to change. And it remains unclear if the U.S. or Iran will make any progress or gain additional support. Tangent: Iran said Monday that a British-flagged tanker was free to go, after it seized the vessel in July for allegedly violating international maritime rules. Iran decided it would waive charges against the tanker (which the New York Times called “a rare hint of easing tensions”). Key background: Saudi Arabia’s oil pipeline was attacked September 14. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia hold Iran responsible for the attack. But Iran said the Houthis, an Iranian-backed rebel group from Yemen, carried out the attack. The U.S. disputes Iran’s version of events and, in retaliation, imposed the most severe economic sanctions on it to date. More American military troops will also be sent to Saudi Arabia. If the U.S. or Saudi Arabia strikes Iran, that attack would be considered an act of “all-out war,” according to Iran’s foreign minister.
