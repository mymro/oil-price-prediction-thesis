Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: MPC) is the largest petroleum refinery operator in the United States. Its businesses include petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation. The stock has surged almost 20% over the last month, after activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which holds a ~2.5% stake in Marathon, announced that it would seek to split the company into three units – spinning off the Speedway gas-station business and pipeline operations into separate companies, while leaving the core refining operations as the new Marathon. Elliott’s solid track record and the potential shareholder value that such a move would create are likely to have increased investor interest in the stock, which has underperformed this year as volatile crude oil prices created headwinds for its refining operations. Below, we provide an overview of how Marathon has fared over the last few years and the outlook for the company.
