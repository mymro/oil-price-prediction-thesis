All five major averages ended last week below their five-week modified moving averages with declining 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastics. This defines negative weekly charts. Tech stocks have been hit by the China trade war. Bank stocks lag on worries about refinancing of corporate bonds. The energy sector slump as crude oil declines. Retail stocks fall hard on concerns of increased costs due to tariffs. The unwinding of the Federal Reserve balance sheet is a tightening of monetary policy. When the Federal Reserve unwinds its balance sheet money is drained from the banking system in what’s called “quantitative tightening.” The Fed reduced its balance sheet by $27 billion during the week ended on May 15, then by another $5 billion during the week of May 22. On May 22 the balance sheet was marked at $3.860 trillion, down $640 billion since the end of September 2017 when quantitative tightening began. The unwinding will end at the end of September but will not meet Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s stated goal of a $3.5 trillion balance sheet.

How to use my value levels and risky levels: Value levels and risky levels are based upon the last nine weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual closes. The first set of levels was based upon the closes on December 31. The original semiannual and annual levels remain in play. The weekly level changes each week; the monthly level was changed at the end of January, February, March and April. The quarterly level was changed at the end of March. My theory is that nine years of volatility between closes are enough to assume that all possible bullish or bearish events for the stock are factored in. To capture share price volatility investors should buy on weakness to a value level and reduce holdings on strength to a risky level. A pivot is a value level or risky level that was violated within its time horizon. Pivots act as magnets that have a high probability of being tested again before its time horizon expires. How to use 12x3x3 Weekly Slow Stochastic Readings: My choice of using 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic readings was based upon back-testing many methods of reading share-price momentum with the objective of finding the combination that resulted in the fewest false signals. I did this following the stock market crash of 1987, so I have been happy with the results for more than 30 years. The stochastic reading covers the last 12 weeks of highs, lows and closes for the stock. There is a raw calculation of the differences between the highest high and lowest low versus the closes. These levels are modified to a fast reading and a slow reading and I found that the slow reading worked the best. The stochastic reading scales between 00.00 and 100.00 with readings above 80.00 considered overbought and readings below 20.00 considered oversold. Recently I noted that stocks tend to peak and decline 10% to 20% and more shortly after a reading rises above 90.00, so I call that an inflating parabolic bubble as a bubble always pops. I also call a reading below 10.00 as being “too cheap to ignore.”
