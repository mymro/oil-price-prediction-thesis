Big oil companies’ earnings are highly correlated with crude oil prices. For instance, oil giant Exxon Mobil‘s net margin dipped to 2.7% in 2016 when the average WTI crude oil price touched $43, while the figure improved more than two-fold to 5.7% in 2017 as the average benchmark oil price for the year recovered to nearly $51. We have created an interactive dashboard that shows how changes in benchmark crude oil prices and benchmark natural gas prices (Henry-Hub) can impact Exxon Mobil’s valuation. The dashboard gives a compact overview of Exxon Mobil’s valuation using key metrics that matter, and allows users to run scenarios to understand upside and risk posed by oil price fluctuations. It includes a base scenario as well as a downside scenario in which oil prices fall again. Sensitivity Analysis Our regression model connects benchmark prices with those of Exxon Mobil’s products. The company’s Crude Oil / NGL price per barrel, other upstream revenue per barrel, petroleum revenue per barrel, and chemicals revenue per metric ton are highly correlated with the benchmark WTI crude oil price. Similarly, Exxon Mobil’s natural gas price per MMBTU is correlated with benchmark Henry Hub natural gas price. Our base case forecasts that the average benchmark crude oil price for 2018 will exceed $54, and benchmark natural gas prices will increase to more than $2.70. This will have a positive impact on average price realizations for Exxon Mobil’s products, resulting in net income of more than $22 billion and EPS of over $5.20. This gives us a price estimate of $94 for Exxon’s stock, nearly 20% ahead of the current market price, assuming a P/E multiple of 18 (same as that for 2017). However, in a scenario where oil prices fall again this year, a better estimate for Exxon Mobil’s stock price would be close to $72, which is nearly 10% below the market price. Like our charts?
