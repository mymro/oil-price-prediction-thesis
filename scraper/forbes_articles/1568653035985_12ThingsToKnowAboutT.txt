Here are a dozen things everyone should know about the past weekend’s strikes on a major Saudi oil refinery, and the likely fallout from them:   So, the bottom line here is that this is a major disruption event - the largest the world has ever seen - with no easy, quick solution likely to materialize. Alby Modiano, President of the U.S. Oil and Gas Association (USOGA) reminded me that, “The tremendous strides of our domestic producers over the last decade, significantly increasing oil and natural gas production at home is fortuitous. Without their efforts and investment the events of this past weekend might have spelled a disaster many magnitudes more than what may ripple from the Middle East over the next few months.”   Mr. Modiano added, “History teaches us that complacency to the ever-present tenuous nature of the world oil market is never rewarded.” Fortunately for Americans, their oil and gas industry hasn’t been complacent recently.
