As the world's second largest oil producer (behind the U.S.), Russia's oil production hit a post-Soviet record in 2018, at 11.3 million b/d, or 11-12% of the global market. Joining an OPEC-led bloc to keep oil off the global market to push prices up, Russia to start the year had agreed to cut 228,000 b/d from October levels. Yet in March, the nationâ€™s production was just 190,000 b/d less. The U.S.-Russia story over the past five years or so has brought up many important questions and discussions. As a sanctioned U.S. country, the question I want to answer: Do We Import Oil From Russia?     Yes, we get about 2% of our total oil demand and 4% of our imports supplied by Russia  U.S. imports from Russia, however, have fallen 40% since peaking in 2011 And only 10-15% of the oil that we get from Russia is crude oil, with petroleum products accounting for the rest. This fall makes sense since U.S. crude production has more than doubled since 2011 to around 12.2 million b/d today, while domestic demand has been flat at 19-20 million b/d. Russia's oil exports in 2018 totaled $130 billion, up nearly 40% from the year before. And the country has slow growing domestic needs to use more oil, so the ability to export will remain strong. Each year, Russia has an extra 8-9 million b/d of crude oil available for export, the largest oil surplus in the world. Russia would be just fine with oil prices at $40-45, while the Saudis prefer oil at least $70, or maybe even $95 to balance its budget. "Russia may dump OPEC oil deal to fight for market share," perhaps pushing oil to $40 or below. Oil prices would fall to that level if OPEC abandoned its deal as well. Russia has around 110 billion barrels of proven oil, basically what it had 20 years ago. In contrast, U.S. proven reserves have increased 66% over that time to 50 billion barrels. Russia realizes the undeniable ongoing importance of oil and gas and is seeking to develop the Artic for its treasure trove of natural resources. In addition, although the country has not yet needed to exploit it, there is unlimited potential in Russia for shale oil and gas production. We know its coming: "Meet The Oil Shale Eighty Times Bigger Than The Bakken."
