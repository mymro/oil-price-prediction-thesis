(Updated: 8:50 PM) Topline: Iran said it captured a British oil tanker Friday while U.S. officials said the Middle Eastern country seized two such vessels—but Iran said the second tanker was let go after being briefed by officials.   Key background: Just two weeks ago, British forces captured an Iranian oil tanker off the coast of Gibralter, and reported they chased away Iranian vessels attempting to capture one of their tankers in retaliation. The U.K. suspected the Iranian tanker was bound for Syria, according to the BBC. And since the U.S. withdrew from Obama’s Iran deal, tensions have steadily escalated between Iran and the West. In May and June, two different oil tanker attacks occurred off Iran’s coast. Iran denied involvement, but the U.S. blamed the nation for both incidents. When Iran downed a U.S. Navy drone in June, the incident led to Iran severing diplomatic ties with America. Meanwhile, Iran announced this month that it exceeded the limit of enriched uranium in the Obama-era nuclear deal but insisted it would use the material for peaceful purposes only, according to the New York Times.
