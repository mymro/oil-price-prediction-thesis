(Updated: 10:51 AM) Topline: Iranian officials declared Tuesday the diplomatic path between Iran and the U.S. is closed permanently, citing the fresh round of sanctions President Trump imposed on Iran Monday, with Trump slamming Iran’s president for ridiculing the U.S. in a televised address, amid growing evidence the new batch of sanctions are much less effective than Trump’s administration is advertising. Key background: Trump imposed Monday’s sanctions in retaliation for Iran shooting down a U.S. Navy drone it claimed was in its airspace (the U.S. maintains the drone was flying over international waters.) And Tuesday’s announcement of shuttered diplomacy is the latest chapter of a yearlong period of tense U.S./Iran relations, beginning with Trump’s 2018 withdrawal of an international agreement designed to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. In the agreement’s place, Trump imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran. In May and June, two different oil tanker attacks occurred off Iran’s coast. Iran denied involvement, but the U.S. blamed Iran for both incidents. Fears of conflict drove up oil prices, as Iran borders a known shipping route for the global oil supply.
