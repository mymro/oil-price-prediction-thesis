By Jim Wyckoff Of Kitco News Comex gold futures prices ended the U.S. day session weaker Tuesday as prices fell to another 4.5-month low. The key “outside markets” turned bearish for the precious metals as the session wore on Tuesday, as the U.S. dollar index firmed and crude oil prices weakened. Near-term technical remain fully bearish for gold and silver, which is adding to selling pressure. June gold last traded down $5.10 at $1,556.00 an ounce. Spot gold was last quoted down $0.40 an ounce at $1,556.50. July Comex silver last traded down $0.373 at $27.98 an ounce. The U.S. dollar index traded solidly higher and hit a fresh four-month high Tuesday, on fresh safe-haven demand due to the EU situation and the recent JP Morgan news. Crude oil futures prices were lower Tuesday after hitting a 4.5-month of $93.65 on Monday. Crude oil remains in a bearish fundamental and technical posture. The European Union debt and financial crisis is still on the front burner of the market place. Tuesday’s developments included the latest collapse in talks among Greek politicians to form a coalition government. That spooked the market place a bit more. Also, German and Euro zone GDP data was stronger than expected. However, that good news was offset by Moody’s downgrading Italian banks ratings late Monday. That move was not surprising to the market place. There is also increasing talk that Greece will at some point make an exit from the European Union. In other news, famed investor Jimmy Rodgers said on CNBC Monday afternoon that the selling pressure in many commodity futures markets recently is partly due to JP Morgan liquidating at least some of its long positions in commodity futures markets, in light of its $2 billion derivatives trading loss. Latest commitment of traders data from the CFTC does corroborate major speculator long liquidation in many commodity futures markets, especially crude oil. Rodgers also said he remains bullish gold and said this latest pullback in gold prices will prove to be a value-buying opportunity.
