The technical action of crude oil and two popular oil ETFs suggests they are in the process of bottoming, but MoneyShow’s Tom Aspray suggests you remain patient and concentrate on market-leading oil stocks. The market has been quite strong this week, as better-than-expected earnings have surprised many investors. This could turn out to be a better earnings season than most expect, and as I discussed last week, it could be enough to kick off a strong year-end election rally. The market internals like the NYSE Advance/Decline line are positive, but have not yet confirmed a major new uptrend, so the “Bear Flag or Bear Trap? debate” has not yet been resolved. It could be today if the A/D ratios are positive. The September crude oil contract is up over 16% from the June low of $77.70, and while the daily technical studies are positive, the weekly analysis suggests that a bottom has not yet been completed. Some of the oil stocks like Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO) are already leading the S&P 500 higher, after Diamond announced earnings along with a special cash dividend this morning. Click to Enlarge Chart Analysis: The daily chart of the continuous crude oil contract shows that the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement resistance at $89.90 is now being tested. The daily Starc+ band is now just above $93. The United States Oil Fund LP (USO) tracks the performance of the West Texas intermediate light sweet crude oil contract, and has an expense ratio of 0.65%. The weekly chart shows a potential double bottom (line e). Click to Enlarge The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration ETF (XOP) has 75 holdings, with the top ten comprising only 17% of the fund. It has a low expense ratio of 0.36%. The daily downtrend (line a) was broken in early July before XOP pulled back to just below its 20-day EMA. Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO) closed Wednesday at the daily downtrend (line f) in the $64 area. The 50% Fibonacci retracement resistance from the March high of $72.80 is at $64.30. What it Means: Given last week’s close in crude oil, I was looking for greater strength in the energy markets this week. Though oil prices have likely seen their low, I would not be surprised to see a drop back toward last week’s lows before the bottom formations are complete. Some stocks like Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO) are already leading the S&P 500 higher, but with this morning’s surprising announcement of a cash dividend, it is likely to move sharply higher over the near term. Therefore, I would only look to buy it on the next pullback. How to Profit: For SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration ETF (XOP), go 50% long at $48.66 and 50% long at $47.90, with a stop at $45.88 (risk of approx. 5%). For Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO), go 50% long at $60.86 and 50% long at $59.90, with a stop at $57.72 (risk of approx. 4.4%).
