There is an old market maxim that major corrections generate leadership changes. The worst performers frequently rebound quickly at lows. Below, we see the relative strength ratings versus the S&P 500 for the sectors at the December 24 low. Note that energy was in last place. Chart 1 In the next chart, we indeed see that energy has led the rally from the December 24 low . Chart 2 In chart 3, the daily price, momentum and relative strength are graphed. Note that the relative strength (green line) has only recently made a low. If a sector or stock rally is to sustain, there is usually a period of relative strength over 3 to 6 months prior to the low. This is not the case here. Chart 3 The histogram of oil prices (from 1983) depicts a period of seasonal strength from January through April. Keep in mind that this is a seasonal and therefore a static cycle. Chart 4 At the recent oil price low, crude had retraced 61.8% of its entire 2016-2018 rally. Chart 5 is that of the dynamic monthly cycle for crude oil. Note that the cycle both topped and bottomed late in relation to the cycle. The cycle bottomed in November-December, but price only bottomed in late December. Note that this cycle reinforces the seasonal tendency to rise in March-April. The monthly cycle falls into late September as seasonal weakness begins. So, the static seasonal cycle and the dynamic cycle are synchronized on both the upside and the downside. The conclusion is that energy stocks are likely to be leaders through April. A fall in energy and in energy stocks is likely from late April through September. The lack of relative strength at the recent low is an indication that the energy sector is unlikely to sustain its leadership through yearend. Chart 5
