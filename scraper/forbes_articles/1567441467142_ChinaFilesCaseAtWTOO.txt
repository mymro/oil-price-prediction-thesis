Topline: China has officially complained to the World Trade Organisation over the latest U.S. tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports, a day after the two nations embark on a new round of tit-for-tat duties, Reuters reported.   What to watch for: The U.S. has 60 days to settle this latest legal case, which is the third brought by Beijing against Trump-imposed tariffs. That could see China asking for the WTO, which determines the maximum level of duties that can be imposed, to adjudicate, Reuters reported. The process could take years. Key background: By December, all of the $550 billion worth of Chinese goods imported by the U.S. will be affected by Trump's punitive duties, as Washington is set to increase existing 25% of tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, to 30% from October 1. The U.S. has justified its tariffs by claiming they are a response to China’s “aggressive industrial policy measures” and alleged theft of intellectual property, an issue which the States said should not be judged by the WTO, although critics think otherwise. China has denied the claims of unfair trade and retaliated with tariffs of its own, leading to a trade battle which has rocked markets and triggered fears of a global recession. Trump’s hopes of a breakthrough were dashed following the G7 last week, after Beijing denied that it had held talks with U.S. officials about restarting negotiations.
