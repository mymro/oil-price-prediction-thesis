Two months ago, a new Airbus aircraft, the A321LR, flew 4750 nautical miles, from the Seychelles to Toulouse, France with a simulated load of 160 dummies. The company claimed a distance record for a single-aisle twin jet. Now, rumor has it, Airbus will roll out another, even longer range version, the A321XLR. Jet fuel is the biggest single expense for most airlines, eating from 15 percent to as much as one-third of revenue. So with oil prices touching $80 a barrel, and potentially heading back to $100, fuel efficiency is the new watchword from Airbus, creator of the A340 and A380 four-engine gas guzzlers. As the CEO of Qantas, Alan Joyce, put it, “If we were to fly two 787s tail-to-tail, the per-seat cost would be less than the A380.”    Now Airbus is trying to push the economy envelope—and tweak long-time rival Boeing—with the A321XLR. The A321 family, (originally a stretched version of the popular A320) has already been a sales success. More than 1600 have been delivered, (American Airlines operates more than 200) with another 2000 on order. The new version of the aircraft supposedly dubbed the A321XLR for ‘xtra long range’, does not yet exist. It is, however, a potential card for Airbus to play in its perpetual poker game with Boeing, this time over who will win the market share war in the so-called “middle of the market” (200-270-seat aircraft) segment. This market sweet spot may be worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 20 years, as flocks of economical aircraft fly point-to-point, pushing superjumbos like the A380 into extinction.  The designs competing for this massive market are the Airbus A321XLR and Boeing's long-rumored 797. The 797 is a fuel-efficient design slated to replace Boeing’s aging 757 and compete with the already-announced A321LR. The 757, last built in 2004, is also in Airbus’ sights, as the company claims that its A321LR will have a 25–30% lower operating cost than the Boeing. Both future Boeing and Airbus entries would continue to battle in the 200 to 270 passenger segment, although the 797 (if built) would be a completely new aircraft while the A321XLR would be yet another spin off the A321 platform. An Airbus spokesman told us that the A321 has “a market share of 80%” in the lower end of the segment, vs. such craft as the Boeing 737 Max 9. On the other hand, sales of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner have been dominating the market for larger craft, versus the Airbus A330neo. Boeing is said to be working on two versions of the 797, one that can carry up to 225 passengers up to 5000 nautical miles, and another that can fly up to 265 passengers for 4500 nautical miles. Maximum capacity for the competitive Airbus entry, the A321LR, is said to be 244 passengers. Laid out in a two-class configuration (to capture critical big-paying Business Class travelers) the A321LR will instead carry up to 206 people 4600 nautical miles. When the A321LR was originally announced in 2016, Bjorn Kjos, the chief executive officer of low-cost leader, was effusive. “The new ‘short long-haul’ aircraft…fits really well with our global expansion plans and future long-haul network, both in terms of size, range and fuel efficiency...with this order we will have a significant cost advantage and increased competitiveness, which means that we can offer our customers low prices on board brand new aircraft to a wide range of new destinations.” With similar efficiencies and an even longer range, the A321XLR will up the ante in the poker game, if it does leap off the drawing board and into the skies. If it achieves ranges greater than the 4500 nautical miles predicted for the A321LR, (one nautical mile = 1.1508 statute miles) the proposed A321XLR would allow US and other low-cost operators to consider intercontinental service. Of course, if the proposed A321XLR carries extra fuel, it’s unclear whether that would come at the cost of paying passengers. Adding fuel tanks can mean subtracting passengers and payload. That’s why Singapore Airline’s previous nonstop service from Singapore to New York, using gas-eating A340s with only 100 Business Class seats, was unprofitable. The new Singapore Airlines flights to New York, scheduled for October, will feature A350ULR (ultra-long range) aircraft with 161 Business Class and Premium Economy seats. No range estimates are available for the A321XLR. But an economical single-aisle jet capable of flying over 5000 nautical miles (a non-stop flight from Dallas, TX to Paris, France is 4927 miles) with 200 or more passengers would certainly make every airline take note. Will the A321XLR actually be built? What is its range and seating capacity? Or is it just vaporware, floated to make Boeing show its hand on the 797? Airbus is keeping its cards close to its chest. As a spokesman put it, “The A321 is an aircraft with lots of potential, and we are continuously looking at ways to advance our product line. However, we do not comment on our specific product policy.”
