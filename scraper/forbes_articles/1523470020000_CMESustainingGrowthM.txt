Recent rate hikes and the Fed’s indications of a series of hikes in the year ahead has boosted investor interest in interest rate derivatives, with trading volumes 29% ahead of the levels seen in Q1 2017. Energy derivatives maintained solid volumes with the recent surge in oil prices and OPEC’s recent stance on capping production.
