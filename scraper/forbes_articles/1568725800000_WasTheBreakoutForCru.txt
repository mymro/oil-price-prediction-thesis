I have been showing a potential breakout in Nymex crude oil for the last few weeks. The breakout for oil is on the daily and weekly charts, not at the gasoline pump. Last week the price per gallon for regular gasoline was $2.359 in Tampa Bay, Florida. Today, as I left my community to run some errands and I predicted that the price per gallon would be up to $2.599. I was wrong. I filled-up at $2.289 per gallon. What does that mean? Is it a sign of economic weakness? All I know is that the Racetrack Gas Station near me always raises the price at the pump immediately after a crude oil rally. What we had over the weekend was a 14% breakout for crude oil that was ignored by Racetrack. This could mean that the rise in crude oil prices is temporary. Let’s look at the breakout on the daily and weekly charts. The Daily Chart for Crude Oil The daily chart for crude oil shows that oil is consolidating a bear market decline of 44% from its October 2, 2018 high of $75.90 to its December 24 low of $42.36. Since bottoming as 2019 began, crude oil has been above its annual value level at $38.76. At mid-year, a semiannual value level formed at $47.93. Crude oil is above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages at $56.28 and $56.30, respectively, which targets monthly and quarterly risky levels at $68.34 and $75.38, respectively. I have been tracking the iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust ETF (GSG),which is 60% weighted to energy. I have been predicting a breakout above the 200-week simple moving average or “reversion to the mean,” which occurred at Monday’s open. The weekly chart is positive with the exchange-traded fund gapping above its five-week modified moving average at $15.26 and above its 200-week simple moving average or reversion to the mean at $15.41 defining a technical breakout. The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading is projected to rise to 38.78 this week, up from 29.94 on September 13. The upside on this breakout is its monthly and quarterly risky levels at $16.99 and $18.23, respectively.
