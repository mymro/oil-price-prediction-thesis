Topline: The Trump administration discussed the option of killing Iran’s top military figure Qassem Soleimani as far back as June, undermining President Donald Trump’s claim that he acted to thwart imminent attacks on U.S. embassies.   Key background: Decades of sour relations between Iran and the U.S. reached fresh lows after Soleimani was killed in a drone strike ordered by President Donald Trump. His killing followed the death of an American civilian contractor in Iraq in late December, which Trump blamed on Iran. Iran’s downing of the plane came just hours after Iranian forces launched ballistic missiles at American forces in Iraq. Over the weekend, national security adviser Mark O’Brien told Fox News that concerns about imminent attacks on U.S. embassies were “consistent with intelligence,” while Esper told CBS that he didn’t see a specific threat to embassies. The mixed messages adds to questions around the administration’s motivations for the strike. Chief critic: Michael McCain, CEO of Maple Leaf Foods, blasted Trump’s “ill-conceived” handling of U.S.-Iran relations for resulting in the downing of the Ukraine International Airlines flight, in which the wife and the 11-year-old son of an employee of the Canadian meat producer were killed. “A narcissist in Washington tears world accomplishments apart”, he wrote on Twitter. Tangent: Oil prices rose again on Monday. Last week, prices for benchmark Brent crude rose to a four-month high amid heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S. and in anticipation of retaliatory attacks from Tehran. Prices fell towards the end of the week but rose slightly on Monday on hopes that the U.S. and China would sign a preliminary trade deal on Wednesday.
