Oil and natural gas prices have either been too low, flat, or falling in recent months. The U.S.-China trade war, record high U.S. crude output, and geopolitical risks have stagnated the oil market. Mild weather amid record U.S. production have sunk the gas market to its lowest summer prices since 1998. In turn, the oil rig count fell again (down 12) during the week, while the gas count remained at 162. The combined rig count is now down 14% from the 1,048 rigs working a year ago at this time In fact, at 742, the oil rig count is its lowest point since the first week of January 2018, with gas at its lowest since mid-April 2017. Since the beginning of the year, oil rigs are down over 15%, with the gas count down 18%. Responsible for 35% of U.S. crude production, the Permian basin has lost 58 oil rigs since the beginning of the year. In Appalachia, yielding ~37% of U.S. gas supply, the Marcellus play has lost 16 gas rigs since peaking at 68 in early-April, with the Utica losing 7 since peaking at 20 in mid-May. What is amazing is that despite a slowdown in activity, oil and gas output has continued to rise at all-time records , even though lower prices give little incentive to boost production Looking at EIA's Drilling Productivity Report, the September production numbers will be even higher: oil adding 85,000 b/d, with gas production adding 0.730 Bcf/d. Indeed, the U.S. oil and gas industry continues to do more with less: "US shale industry turns cash flow positive." Farther out, more takeaway will continue to offer pricing relief for Permian producers. More pipelines and exports have U.S. crude now trading at $5.00 to $5.50 discount to Brent, down from ~$8.60 in the second quarter. The mighty Permian could add another 4 million b/d of supply by 2022, which will be essential to a mushrooming export complex along the Gulf of Mexico.
