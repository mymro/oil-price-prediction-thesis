Blue chip oil stock Exxon Mobil was last seen down 2% at $77.61, due in part to headwinds throughout the energy sector following comments from the International Energy Agency (IEA) about an "unprecedented period of uncertainty" in oil markets. Adding salt to the wounds is a downgrade at Raymond James to "underperform" from "market perform." This price action puts XOM shares back in the $76-$78 area that's contained pullbacks since April, and which is also home to a 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the security's pullback from its late-January 52-week high to its low in April. Taking a shorter-term view, the shares have shed 9.1% this quarter. If Exxon doesn't turn things around quickly, we could see additional bear notes in the future. For instance, the equity's average 12-month price target stands up at $89.42 -- an almost 16% premium to current trading levels, and in 52-week-high territory.    In the options pits, traders have continued to target long calls. Data from the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) shows a 10-day call/put volume ratio of 1.85, meaning call buying has almost doubled put buying in recent weeks -- though this reading ranks in just the 33rd annual percentile.
