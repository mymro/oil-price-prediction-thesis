Topline: Iran said on Monday that it’s doubling the number of advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium in a further retreat from the 2015 nuclear deal, with the announcement falling on the 40th anniversary of the U.S. embassy hostage crisis.   Big number: 11 pounds. That’s the amount of enriched uranium Iran is producing each day with its new centrifuges. Before that, it was producing only one pound per day. What to watch for: Iran will reportedly announce further violations of the nuclear deal in the coming week, but it’s unclear exactly when that might happen. Key background: The U.S. and Iran have been at loggerheads since 2018 when President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, an agreement that kept Iran from having a nuclear weapon. In an attempt to force Iran into a new deal that would include scaling back its ballistic missile program and activities in the region, Trump levied severe economic sanctions against the country and government officials. A series of escalating attacks beginning in June⁠—on oil tankers, Saudi oil facilities and military drones⁠—had the U.S. blaming Iran, while Iran denied involvement. But Iran reportedly will continue nuclear deal violations in the hopes that European countries that signed on will help sell its oil abroad.
