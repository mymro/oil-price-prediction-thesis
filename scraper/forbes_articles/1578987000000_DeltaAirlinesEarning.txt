Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL) is slated to release its full-year 2019 results on Tuesday, January 14. Trefis details expectations from the airline company in an interactive dashboard, parts of which are highlighted below. We believe that Delta Airlines will report weaker-than-expected revenues and earnings for FY 2019. We expect Delta to report revenues of $46.8 billion for the year thanks to growing capacity across destinations, although our estimate is slightly below the consensus figure of $46.9 billion. Also, earnings are likely to be around $6.67 (vs. consensus estimate of $7.01) due to a combination of lower-than-expected revenues and elevated operating expenses. That said, we believe that weaker-than-expected revenues and earnings for FY 2019 do not take away from Delta’s strong growth opportunity in the near future, and estimate Delta Airlines’ valuation to be $63 a share – roughly 5% above its current market price.
