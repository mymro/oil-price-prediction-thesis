ST PETERSBURG, June 7 (Reuters) - Russia will use the National Wealth Fund to finance Gazpromâ€™s new chemical and liquefied natural gas project in the Baltic port of Ust-Luga, Deputy Finance Minister Andrei Ivanov said on Friday. Gazprom said the project would require equipment purchases of at least 900 billion roubles ($13.87 billion). Gazprom had initially planned to build only an LNG plant in the area with Royal Dutch Shell. It changed its mind earlier this year and redesigned the project to add a chemical plant, prompting Shell to leave the project.
