LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Iran’s oil minister said on Monday that an OPEC meeting did not give a positive response to the demands of U.S. President Donald Trump, saying that the “U.S. dream” to cut Iranian oil exports to zero would not happen. “The U.S. seeks to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero even for a month, but that dream would not come to reality,” Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying by ISNA news agency.
