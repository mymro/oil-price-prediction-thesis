MOSCOW (Reuters) - An oil price of $60-65 per barrel would be comfortable for participants in the deal agreed by the OPEC+ group of producers to limit supply, Leonid Fedun, vice president of Russian oil producer Lukoil, said on Tuesday. The OPEC+ group of producers have committed to some of the sectorâ€™s deepest output cuts in a decade starting Jan. 1 in an effort to avert oversupply and support prices. Fedun said price shocks would only happen if producers violate their commitments. At 0753 GMT, the price of Brent crude oil was $65.5 per barrel.
