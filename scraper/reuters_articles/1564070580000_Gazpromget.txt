MOSCOW (Reuters) - Gazprom (GAZP.MM), the world’s biggest conventional gas producer, said on Thursday it had received bids worth 198.89 billion roubles ($3.15 billion) for 3% of its own shares that it is selling into the market.  Gazprom is selling a 3% stake as it is taking advantage of the company’s stock price being near its highest level in more than a decade. The stake is worth $2.3 billion, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
