MOSCOW, April 9 (Reuters) - Russian lender Gazprombank said in a presentation that Brexit could drive up the cost of borrowing and cost of financial services for Russian gas giant Gazprom. In the presentation, which was dated March 7 and which was seen by Reuters, Gazprombank said it recommended that Gazprom monitors the pound-denominated debt market and exits the market if possible. It advised Gazprom to increase debt-raising on European financial markets other than London and said the Swiss franc-denominated debt market could be a good source of capital for the gas producer, post-Brexit, according to the presentation. The bank also said in the presentation it recommended that Gazprom considers issuing bonds in Chinese yuan.
