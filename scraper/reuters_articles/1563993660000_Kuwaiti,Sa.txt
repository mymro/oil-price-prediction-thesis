CAIRO, July 24 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s minister of state for energy affairs visited Kuwait to discuss resuming production in jointly operated fields in the Saudi–Kuwaiti Neutral Zone, Kuwaiti state news agency KUNA said on Wednesday. The visit was to discuss resuming production after settling all technical issues from both sides. The Saudi–Kuwaiti Neutral Zone, or Divided Zone, is an area of 5,770 square km between the borders of OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that was left undefined when the border was established in 1922. The two countries halted output from the jointly run oilfields - Khafji and Wafra - in the Neutral Zone more than four years ago, cutting some 500,000 barrels per day or 0.5 percent of global oil supply.
