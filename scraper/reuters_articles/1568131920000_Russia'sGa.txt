MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian natural gas producer Gazprom’s export arm Gazprom Export said on Tuesday it was studying the legal and commercial consequences of a court ruling which reinstated curbs on gas flows via the Opal pipeline. Europe’s top court on Tuesday overruled an EU decision allowing Gazprom to ship more gas via Opal, a pipeline which links Gazprom’s Nord Stream pipeline to Germany.
