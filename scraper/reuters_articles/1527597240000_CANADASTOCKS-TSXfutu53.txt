May 29 (Reuters) - Futures prices pointed to a lower opening for Canada’s main stock index on Tuesday following a sell-off in global equities triggered by a worsening Italian political crisis. Investors fear that repeat elections - which now seem inevitable in Italy - may become a de facto referendum on Italian membership of the currency bloc and the country’s role in the European Union. June futures on the S&P TSX index were down 0.68 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET.
