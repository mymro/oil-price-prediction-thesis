Feb 7 (Reuters) - Futures for Canada’s main stock index dipped on Friday, weighed down by lower oil prices as Russia said it would need more time before committing to deeper output cuts. Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday Russia needed a few days to analyse the oil market and would clarify its position on deeper cuts next week. Novak predicted global oil demand may fall by 150,000-200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2020 amid the coronavirus - a relatively conservative forecast.
