* Wall St rally stalls ahead of tax bill vote * Dollar regains footing on data * Gold holds firm as dollar wilts * U.S. yields rise on housing starts data before tax bill decision (Updates with afternoon trading) By Laila Kearney NEW YORK, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street and other global stock markets fell slightly on Tuesday, with investors taking profits after recent highs in the tech sector before U.S. Republican lawmakers reach their goal of passing tax legislation. U.S. stocks have hit successive highs ahead of the tax overhaul bill, but modest selling has crept into the market as most traders see the positive impact of cuts to corporate taxes already priced into the market. The U.S. dollar regained some footing after early losses, aided by upbeat U.S. housing data. The U.S. House of Representatives will vote in the afternoon and a Senate decision could come Tuesday night on what would be the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years. The plan includes slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, which analysts say would likely increase profits, buybacks and dividend payouts. Despite growing optimism about the tax bill’s passage, a slump in technology stocks, led by Apple Inc, helped to drag markets down in afternoon trading. Some investors said they were pausing to see the voting results. “There is high confidence that it will get passed, but there is a very narrow margin for error, within the Senate especially. So there’s a little bit of a pause to see what’s going to happen,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer of Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
