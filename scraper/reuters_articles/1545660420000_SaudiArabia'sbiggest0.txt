RIYADH/DUBAI, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s National Commercial Bank (NCB), the kingdom’s biggest lender by assets, has begun preliminary discussions to merge with smaller rival Riyad Bank, the two lenders said on Monday. A merger would further extend NCB’s lead over its closest rivals including Al Rajhi Bank, by boosting its assets by almost a third to 685 billion riyals ($183 billion) The move comes two months after Saudi British Bank (SABB) and smaller rival Alawwal Bank agreed on a binding deal to create Saudi Arabia’s third-biggest lender in the first major tie-up for the country’s banking sector. NCB said any agreement would be subject to regulatory and shareholders approvals.
