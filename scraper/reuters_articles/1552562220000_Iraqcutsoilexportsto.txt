BAGHDAD, March 14 (Reuters) - Iraq has cut its oil exports average to 3.5 million barrels per day in compliance with an ongoing production curb agreement, its oil minister said on Thursday. Thamer Ghadhban told reporters an OPEC meeting in Vienna in April would assess member statesâ€™ compliance with agreed production cuts and whether to extend the curbs until the end of the year. Iraq is committed to the deal and working to stabilise markets, he said. (Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed; Writing by John Davison; Editing by Mark Potter)
