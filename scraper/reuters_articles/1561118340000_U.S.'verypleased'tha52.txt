RIYADH (Reuters) - The United States is “very pleased” that Saudi Arabia is making sure that the global oil market is well supplied, a U.S. official said on Friday, amid fears of energy disruption because of growing military tension in the Middle East. “They have been very helpful at ensuring the well-supplied and stable oil market, and so we’re very pleased,” U.S. envoy on Iran, Brian Hook, told a news conference in the Saudi capital Riyadh.
