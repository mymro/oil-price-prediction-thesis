(Adds details) DUBAI, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Bahrain’s real gross domestic product grew 0.8% in Q2 year-on-year, according to preliminary government data, as growth in the non-oil sector offset a decline in oil output. The small Gulf Arab oil producer saw a 0.8% drop in the oil sector in the second quarter, mainly because of a 5.8% decline in the production of oil from the offshore Abu Safah field, which it shares with Saudi Arabia. Annual growth in the non-oil sector was 1.2%, the ministry of finance said in a statement late on Monday. Bahrain’s total GDP in Q2 stood at 3.2 billion dinars ($8.49 billion), it said. The Bahraini government received pledges of $10 billion last year from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates after low oil prices pushed its public debt to almost 93% of gross domestic product. As part of the financial aid from its wealthier Gulf allies, Bahrain has embarked on a series of economic reforms aimed at balancing its budget by 2022. Bahrain expects a fiscal deficit of 4.7% of GDP this year and 3.9% next year, the ministry said on Monday, confirming previous estimates. It forecasts real GDP to grow 2.1% this year and 2.7% next year, it said.
