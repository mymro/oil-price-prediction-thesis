RIYADH (Reuters) - OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said on Wednesday the group is concerned that sanctions against two of its founding members - Venezuela and Iran - could complicate efforts to re-balance and sustain the oil market. April will be a good time to assess the market, and take a decision accordingly, Barkindo told Reuters on the sidelines of an oil conference in Riyadh.
