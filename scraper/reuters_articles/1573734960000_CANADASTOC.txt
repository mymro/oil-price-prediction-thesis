Nov 14 (Reuters) - Futures for Canada’s main stock index edged up on Thursday, buoyed by gains in oil prices following a surprise drop in U.S. crude inventories and OPEC’s comment about lower-than-expected U.S. shale production in 2020. The American Petroleum Institute reported on Wednesday an unexpected drop in U.S. crude stockpiles by 541,000 barrels in the week to Nov. 8, against analysts’ expectations of an increase of 1.6 million barrels. Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said there would likely be downward revisions of supply going into 2020, especially from U.S. shale.
