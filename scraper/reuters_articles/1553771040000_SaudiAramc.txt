DUBAI, March 28 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco will start meeting bond investors next week ahead of its planned debut international bond, which will likely help it fund the $69.1 billion purchase of a stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), sources familiar with the matter said. The Saudi oil giant, which declined to comment, said on Wednesday it had agreed to buy a 70 percent stake in SABIC from Saudi Arabiaâ€™s Public Investment Fund in one of the largest deals in the global chemicals industry. The planned bond, which the Saudi energy minister previously said would be around $10 billion in size, is expected to price in around two weeks, after a series of meetings with bond investors, the sources said.
