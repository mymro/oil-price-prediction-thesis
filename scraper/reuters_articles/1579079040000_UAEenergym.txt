ABU DHABI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emiratesâ€™ energy minister said on Wednesday he expects a positive meeting when OPEC+ meets next in March. OPEC and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, is capable of doing whatever is needed to achieve a balanced oil market, Suhail al-Mazrouei told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference in Abu Dhabi.
