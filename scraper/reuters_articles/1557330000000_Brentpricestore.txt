LONDON, May 8 (Reuters) - * Lack of clarity in oil fundamentals will keep Brent crude price volatility high in the next couple months, testing Goldman Sach’s expected boundary range of $70-$75/bbl, the bank said in a note * “In the coming weeks, however, we believe that the recent Brent pull-back has taken prices too low in the face of tight fundamentals and growing supply risks (Iran, Venezuela, Libya, Russia), just as refiners come back from extended spring,” the banks said * The bank expects a balanced oil market beyond the next couple of months once new Permian transport capacity in the United States is online and core-OPEC members increase production. * Goldman maintains view that Brent oil prices will decline to $65.50/bbl in Q3 2019 (Reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)
