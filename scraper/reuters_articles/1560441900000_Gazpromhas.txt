MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday that Gazprom had offered Ukraineâ€™s Naftogas an out of court settlement designed to end a legal dispute between the two companies in a Swedish court. Novak was speaking at a news conference in Moscow with European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic. Novak said the resolution of the complex gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev would allow Russia to continue gas transit through Ukraine on prior terms. Novak said the best time for three-way talks between Moscow, Kiev and Brussels was during the second half of September.
