ALGIERS (Reuters) - A fire at Algerian energy firm Sonatrachâ€™s GNL1Z gas production unit in the city of Oran will have no impact on output, the company said on Tuesday. Two people were injured in the fire, Sonatrach said in a statement. Video posted online overnight showed a large fire at the site, and private broadcaster Ennahar had said that the fire had been followed by several explosions. Algeria is a major gas exporter, serving mainly European markets, and is also an OPEC oil producer.
