Aug 22 (Reuters) - Futures for Canada’s main stock index were little changed on Thursday as doubts about a fresh cycle of U.S. rate cuts offset a rise in crude oil prices. Minutes of the Federal Reserve July meeting, released on Wednesday, showed policymakers were divided over whether to cut interest rates but united in wanting to signal they were set on more cuts. Oil rose further above $60 a barrel on Thursday, supported by a drop in U.S. crude inventories and OPEC-led supply cuts, although worries about the global economy weighed.
