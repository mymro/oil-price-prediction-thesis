BRUSSELS, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The European Union on Tuesday said limits on Gazprom’s access to the Opal gas pipeline will apply after Europe’s top court rejected a later decision that lifted curbs on flows via Opal from Russia’s Nord Stream pipeline to Germany. A spokeswoman for the EU executive said it had no comment on whether it would appeal the European Court of Justice’s ruling against its 2016 decision. “The principle of energy solidarity is highly valued by the European Commission and, as found by the Court, will need to be assessed explicitly in future exemption decisions,” the spokeswoman said. “As the revised Commission decision has been annulled, there is no legal void. The 2009 exemption decision is now again applicable.” (Reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel; editing by Philip Blenkinsop)
