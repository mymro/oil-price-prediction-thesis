March 8 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index dropped for a second day, with oil prices plunging nearly 3 percent after weak China trade data and U.S. jobs growth report sparked fears of slowing global growth. * The energy sector dropped 3.8 percent, leading the eight decliners among the 11 major sectors. U.S. crude prices were down 3 percent, while Brent crude lost 2.8 percent, with surging U.S. supply also unsettling markets. * Global stock markets started on the back foot after data showed China’s exports tumbled the most in three years in February while imports fell for a third straight month. * Another set of numbers from the United States showed job growth almost stalled in February, with the economy creating only 20,000 jobs, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 180,000 jobs. * Both reports added to a weak sentiment even as Canada added far more jobs than expected in February, cooling market expectations that the Bank of Canada could cut interest rates by the end of the year. * At 10:00 a.m. ET (15:00 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was down 150.23 points, or 0.94 percent, at 15,906.28. * The interest-rate sensitive financials sector slipped 0.6 percent, while the industrials sector fell 0.9 percent. * The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners, added 0.7 percent as gold futures rose 1 percent to $1,297.2 an ounce. * The largest percentage gainers on the TSX were Yamana Gold Inc, which jumped 5.1 percent, followed by a 4 percent rise in Kinross Gold. * Enghouse Systems Ltd fell 12.7 percent, the most on the TSX, after reporting quarterly results.
