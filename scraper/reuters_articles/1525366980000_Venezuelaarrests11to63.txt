CARACAS, May 3 (Reuters) - Venezuela said on Thursday it arrested 11 top executives of the country’s leading private bank Banesco for allegedly hurting the OPEC nation’s ailing currency, the latest move against the private sector that unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro blames for a deep economic crisis. Chief prosecutor Tarek Saab announced the arrests on state television, but did not immediately provide evidence of wrongdoing and did not take questions.
