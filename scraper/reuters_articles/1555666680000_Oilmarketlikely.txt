PARIS (Reuters) - Ibrahim al-Muhanna, an adviser to the Saudi energy minister, said on Friday he expected the oil market to be “well balanced” this year. “This year, we have seen the implementation of the OPEC Plus decision. It is possible to extend the cut until the end of the year depending on market conditions,” al-Muhanna told an oil summit in Paris. The OPEC+ group agreed last year to cut production, partly in response to increased U.S. shale output.
