July 3 (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a higher opening for Canada’s main stock index on Wednesday, as oil prices rebounded after a steep fall in the previous session. Oil prices were supported by widely-watched data, which showed a larger-than-expected drawdown in U.S. crude oil inventories, with government data due later in the day. U.S. crude inventories fell by 5 million barrels last week to 469.5 million, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 3 million barrels, industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) said.

Canada’s trade balance data is due at 8:30 a.m. ET The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX rose 89.09 points, or 0.54 percent, to 16,471.29 on Tuesday.
