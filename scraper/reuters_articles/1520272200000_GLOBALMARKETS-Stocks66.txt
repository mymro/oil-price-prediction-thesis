(Updates throughout, changes comment, byline, dateline from previous LONDON) By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices rallied on Monday and stocks across the globe also rose as investors saw tariff threats as a U.S. negotiating tactic and not a done deal, while concern ebbed over an inconclusive Italian election. Stocks across the globe rose after four days of declines, with the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 higher and Europe closing at a session high as pressure grew on U.S. president Donald Trump to back off from planned tariffs on steel and aluminum. “We have at least a bit of a rethink regarding the prospects of trade war,” said Art Hogan of the higher stock prices in the early afternoon. He said the Trump administration “sees the stock market as a report card for success and markets have so far said this trade war is not a good idea.” Trump’s hard talk regarding steel and aluminum tariffs “sounds like we’re shifting back to posturing to get a better NAFTA deal,” Hogan added. Trump said on Monday that Canada and Mexico could avoid being caught in his planned hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports if they ceded ground to Washington in trilateral talks on a new North American trade deal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 191.66 points, or 0.78 percent, to 24,729.72, the S&P 500 gained 21.58 points, or 0.80 percent, to 2,712.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.00 points, or 0.79 percent, to 7,314.87.

The euro, which earlier fell as much as 0.4 percent versus the U.S. dollar, edged higher against most major peers, including the greenback. The common currency was whiplashed by weekend elections, as Germany’s Social Democrats voted to re-enter a grand coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, while results from Italy pointed to a messier outcome than expected - a strong showing for anti-establishment parties and no group able to form a stable government.
