January 30 (Reuters) - Futures for Canada’s main stock index dropped on Thursday, as fears of the economic impact of a globally spreading coronavirus weighed down oil prices. Countries have started isolating hundreds of citizens evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan to stop the spread of the epidemic that has killed 170 people. All eyes were on the World Health Organisation (WHO), which hasn’t declared the flu-like coronavirus a global emergency, but was to reconsider its position later in the day. Meanwhile, investors also considered the possibility of an early OPEC meeting. March futures on the S&P/TSX index were down 0.47% at 7:00 a.m. ET.
