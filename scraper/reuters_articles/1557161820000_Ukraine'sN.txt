KIEV, May 6 (Reuters) - Ukrainian state energy firm Naftogaz has filed a complaint to the European Commission accusing Russia’s Gazprom of anti-competitive actions over the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, it said in a statement said on Monday. The complaint proposes “a series of remedies that would mitigate Gazprom’s anticompetitive behaviour”, the statement said. These include “requiring that Gazprom makes gas available to European purchasers on Ukraine’s Eastern and Western borders at a price equal to the price offered to Nord Stream 2 customers adjusted for relevant transportation costs,” it said.
