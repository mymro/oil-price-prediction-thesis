VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC members agree on the need to extend oil production cuts but are undecided whether it needs to be for six or nine months, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Reuters on Sunday. “Certainly it is a rollover, consensus is emerging ... Everybody I am talking to is assuring that conformity in the second half is going to be a lot more uniform than what we have seen in the first half,” Falih said.
