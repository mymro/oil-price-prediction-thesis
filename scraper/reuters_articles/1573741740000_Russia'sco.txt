MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s competition watchdog said on Thursday it had decided to delay by three months Shell’s (RDSa.L) purchase of 9.3 billion roubles ($145.73 million) worth of shares in a subsidiary of Russian oil producer Gazprom Neft (SIBN.MM). Shell is expected to buy a 50% stake in Meretoyakhaneftegaz, a Gazprom Neft subsidiary which holds licensing rights to the Meretoyakhinskoye oil field.
