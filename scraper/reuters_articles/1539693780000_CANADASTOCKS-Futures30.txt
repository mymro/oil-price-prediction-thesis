Oct 16 (Reuters) - Stock futures for Canada’s main index edged higher on Tuesday, tracking a rebound in global equity markets but gains were capped by losses in energy shares due to fall in oil prices. Oil prices fell amid expectations of an increase in U.S. crude inventories, but signs of Iranian oil exports eased this month, keeping losses in check. December futures on the S&P/TSX index were up 0.08 percent at 6:59 a.m. ET. Data for August on foreign investment in Canadian securities and Canadian investment in foreign securities are due at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX closed down 4.82 points, or 0.03 percent, at 15,409.47 on Monday. Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures were up 0.44 percent at 7:05 a.m. ET, while S&P 500 e-mini futures were up 0.4 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures were up 0.62 percent.
