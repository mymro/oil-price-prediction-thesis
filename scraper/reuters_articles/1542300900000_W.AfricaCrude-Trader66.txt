LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - A surplus of December loading cargoes has largely cleared thanks to a number of tenders, traders said on Thursday, but there was still no sign of any January schedules. * Less than 20 cargoes of Nigerian crude were still available, traders said, with January loading programmes expected to start emerging on Friday. * Only a handful of Bonny Light, Qua Iboe and Forcados cargoes were left. Bonny was being shown at a premium to dated Brent of $1.60 to $1.70 a barrel and Forcados at $1.70. * December loading Bonga was said to be sold out. * The January Angolan programme was not expected to emerge until Monday. * Unipec bought a cargo of Angolan Nemba from Chevron. * Indonesia’s Pertamina took Qua Iboe and Bonny Light from Total and Escravos from Chevron in its early January delivery tender, traders said. * A probe by the Nigerian Senate into whether state oil firm NNPC improperly withdrew money has expanded with the amount under investigation doubling to over $2.2 billion, a committee said on Wednesday. * Without another mega-project like Total’s Kaombo on the horizon and fields getting old, Africa’s second-largest crude producer is facing a steep decline unless it can revive exploration in what was once one of the world’s most exciting offshore prospects.
