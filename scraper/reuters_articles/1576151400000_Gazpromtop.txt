MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian gas producer Gazprom said on Thursday its management board had approved a new dividend policy, recommending increasing dividend payments to at least 50% of net profit within three years. If adjusted net debt to EBITDA exceeds a ratio of 2.5, the board may decide to reduce the size of dividend payments, the company said.
