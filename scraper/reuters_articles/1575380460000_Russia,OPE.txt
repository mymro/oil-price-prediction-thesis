VIENNA (Reuters) - Russia and OPEC are ‘most likely’ to reach consensus at this week’s talks in Vienna, a source familiar with Russian position told Reuters.  The source added that Moscow and OPEC still need to reach agreement on a few issues around quotas and how Russian gas condensate will be accounted in overall Russian liquid production. Moscow wants to exclude condensate from its quotas.   The Russian energy ministry did not immediately reply to a request for a comment.
