Saipem’s head of digital and innovation, Mauro Piasere, told Reuters the attack had originated in Chennai, India. Servers in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait had been attacked as too, partially, had infrastructure in Aberdeen in Scotland, he said. But he added the group’s servers in its main operating centers in Italy, France and Britain had not been affected. “The servers involved have been shut down for the time being to assess the scale of the attack,” he said, adding that data back-up systems would be activated once the threat was eliminated. “There has been no loss of data because all our systems have back-ups,” he said.
