The main index added 0.3%, boosted by Shell and BP, as a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. crude inventories pushed prices higher. The mid-cap FTSE 250 gained 0.2%% by 0707 GMT. Persimmon and other blue-chip housebuilders were lower in early deals after a Reuters poll showed the country’s property market would be further damaged by a potential no-deal Brexit, with average prices slipping about 3% nationally in the ensuing six months.
