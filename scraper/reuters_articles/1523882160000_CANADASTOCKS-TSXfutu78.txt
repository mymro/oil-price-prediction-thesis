April 16 (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a higher opening for Canada’s main stock index on Monday as investors expected that the weekend’s missile attacks on Syria would not escalate into a wider conflict. The U.S., France and Britain launched 105 missiles on Saturday, targeting what they said were three chemical weapons facilities in Syria in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack on April 7. June futures on the S&P TSX index were up 0.11 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET.
