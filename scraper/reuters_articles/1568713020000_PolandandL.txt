WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Tuesday that Poland and Lithuania consider the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project a threat to energy security in central and eastern Europe. “Poland and Lithuania have a very similar stance saying that the construction of Nord Stream 2 is s threat to energy security in this part of Europe,” Morawiecki told a televised news conference with Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.  The Nord Stream 2 project would double Russia’s capacity for piping gas across the Baltic Sea to Germany. Led by Russian gas exporter Gazprom, it is backed by Shell, Germany’s Uniper and BASF unit Wintershall, France’s Engie and Austria’s OMV.
