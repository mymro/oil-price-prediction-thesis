MOSCOW, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Russiaâ€™s Gazprom has begun filling the first part of the undersea TurkStream pipeline with gas, the pipeline operator said on Friday. Russia plans to launch the first part of the pipeline, with annual capacity of 15.75 billion cubic metres, by the end of the year. It is designed to supply Turkish domestic customers. The second part, with the same capacity, is expected to run further - from Bulgaria to Serbia and Hungary - and will be operational at a later stage.
