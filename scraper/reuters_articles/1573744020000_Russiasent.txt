FRANKFURT, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Russia reduced exports of crude oil to Germany in the year to September by 17.8%, still reflecting a halt in the Druzhba pipeline between April and June due to contamination, official data showed. Russia accounted for 30.7% of Germany’s oil receipts in January-September, but at 19.6 million tonnes delivered less than the 23.9 million recorded in the same 2018 period, according to statistics from the BAFA foreign trade office. A drop in shipments by a quarter in January-June had shown how much the contamination affected Russia’s role as top crude supplier, but the shortfalls have been easing since July. Germany spent 24.4 billion euros ($26.9 billion) on crude imports in the nine-month period, 8.1% less than a year earlier, BAFA said. The import volume was 2.6% lower than a year earlier at 63.9 million tonnes, with Norway and Britain together accounting for 23.9% of supply. OPEC member Libya and Kazakhstan were in fourth and fifth position, while the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries overall contributed 23.8%. Average prices paid on the border over the nine months fell by 5.6% to 428.67 euros per tonne. In the Druzhba case, problems remain with the cleaning of pipelines and storage systems after the discovery of excessive levels of organic chlorides that can damage refineries. The aftermath of the crisis also led to protracted negotiations over compensation. ($1 = 0.9074 euros) (Reporting by Vera Eckert; Editing by Dale Hudson)
