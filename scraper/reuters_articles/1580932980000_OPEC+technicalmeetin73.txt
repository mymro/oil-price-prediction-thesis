LONDON/DUBAI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - An OPEC+ committee extended its meeting into a third day on Wednesday and would debate again on Thursday the need to cut oil output in response to the coronavirusâ€™ impact on energy demand and global economic growth. Four sources familiar with the talks said the meeting on Wednesday ended with no concrete recommendation and one source said Russia was not supporting a deeper oil output cut and was suggesting an extension of the current pact.
