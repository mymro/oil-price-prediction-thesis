KIEV (Reuters) - The head of Ukraine’s Naftogaz said on Thursday that Ukraine would need to cut gas consumption by 5-10 percent for four days due to Gazprom’s decision not to deliver prepaid gas to Ukraine. “This step should be sufficient in order not to create a gas deficit in the system,” Naftogaz Chief Executive Andriy Kobolev, adding that the decision would come into force on Saturday.
