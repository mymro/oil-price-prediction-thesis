MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom said on Wednesday it was aware of actions by Ukrainian oil and gas firm Naftogaz to enforce an arbitration court ruling. Naftogaz said earlier on Wednesday it had initiated the enforcement of a $2.6 billion award from the Stockholm arbitration court from Gazprom.
