MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump was right that the current oil price was too high. Putin said at the Russian Energy Week forum that the price has risen because of the U.S. sanctions against one of the top OPEC producers, Iran. We would be happy with the oil price at $65-$75 per barrel, Putin said.
