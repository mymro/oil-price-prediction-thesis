MOSCOW (Reuters) - Ukraine’s Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman said on Friday that any deficit in gas supply following a breakdown in relations with Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM) would be compensated with gas from the European market. Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said earlier it had asked a court to terminate its gas supply and transit contracts with Ukraine after being ordered to pay $2.56 billion to Kiev in a dispute which the EU said could threaten gas flows to Europe. Ukraine would return to a normal supply of gas within five days, Groysman said in a televised briefing, after Ukraine’s Naftogaz NAFTO.UL signed an urgent gas supply contract with Poland’s PGNiG.
