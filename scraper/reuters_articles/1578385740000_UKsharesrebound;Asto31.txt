The FTSE 100 was up 0.2% by 0809 GMT, with gains led by supermarket groups Morrisons and Sainsburyâ€™s . The killing of a top Iranian military commander by the United States had sparked a selloff on Monday, with both the UK benchmark indexes losing nearly 1%. Midcaps added 0.4% as Premier Oil shares surged 12% after a deal to buy certain BP assets, more than offsetting an 11% slide in luxury carmarker Aston Martin following a profit warning.
