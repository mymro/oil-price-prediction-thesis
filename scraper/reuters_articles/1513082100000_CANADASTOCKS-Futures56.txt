Dec 12 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index was set to open little changed on Tuesday, tracking a halt in a three-day rally for global stock markets ahead of a handful of major central bank meetings. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates for the third time in a year when it ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday, while the European Central Bank and the Bank of England both meet for the last time in 2017. December futures on the S&P TSX index were up just 0.02 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET. The materials-heavy Toronto market inched higher on Monday, boosted by gains for energy and other commodity-related stocks as oil prices rose. Brent crude prices gained another 1 percent on Tuesday, but prices of aluminum and copper both fell. For comparison, futures for New York’s Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.11 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET, while S&P 500 e-mini futures gained just 0.06 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures were down 0.01 percent.
