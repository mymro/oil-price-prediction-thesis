* Brexit developments still in focus * Sterling steadies * Texas Instruments revenue forecast hits chipmakers (New throughout, updates prices, market activity and comments; new byline, changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - World stock indexes edged up on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 boosted by gains in shares of Apple that offset Texas Instruments’ disappointing forecast, and the British pound steadied as European Union leaders consider London’s request for a Brexit delay. On Wall Street, chipmakers fell along with shares of Texas Instruments, while Apple shares rose after Morgan Stanley said the iPhone maker’s soon-to-be-launched video streaming service could boost its services revenue. “What I think is causing the hesitation is the fear of other bellwether companies also disappointing,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Sterling inched higher, with European Union leaders expected to grant a three-month extension to the Oct. 31 deadline for Britain’s departure. “While weaker, the bottom hasn’t fallen out of the pound given that a no-deal Brexit has seemingly been taken off the table,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions. The pound was yanked down to $1.2850 from $1.30 after UK lawmakers put the brakes on the government’s Brexit plans again on Tuesday. Sterling was last trading at $1.289, up 0.14% on the day.
