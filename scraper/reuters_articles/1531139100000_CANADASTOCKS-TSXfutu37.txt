July 9 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index was set to open higher on Monday as oil prices made gains on global demand and U.S. efforts to impose sanctions on Iran, which would reduce output. The United States said it wants to reduce oil exports from Iran, the world’s fifth biggest oil producer, to zero by November, in a move that will oblige other big producers such as Saudi Arabia to pump more.
