NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major world stock markets sank for a second straight day on Friday after strong U.S. jobs numbers signaled a continued tightening of the labor market and increased inflation pressures, while Treasury yields rose again to multi-year highs. The increase in U.S. non-farm payrolls slowed in September, likely from Hurricane Florence’s impact on restaurant and retail payrolls, but the Labor Department report also showed a rise in wages that could keep the Federal Reserve on track for more interest rate hikes. “The jobs report has become a inflation report,” said Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Services Inc in Troy, Michigan.
