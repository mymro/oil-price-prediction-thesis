MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is ready to comply with the OPEC+ oil output cut deal in January, Russia’s Interfax news agency quoted Energy Minister Alexander Novak as saying on Wednesday. “Naturally, we have our obligations, we will fulfil them,” he said. OPEC+ has been capping its output since 2017 to balance out supply and demand on the global oil market as well as to prop up oil prices.
