Feb 5 (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a lower opening for Canada’s main stock index on Monday as oil prices fell on rising U.S. production and higher bond yields continued to pressure global stock markets. Canada’s main stock index slumped to a four-month low on Friday, with natural resource shares leading broad based declines as commodity prices dropped, and yields rose.

Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures were down 1.23 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET, while S&P 500 e-mini futures were down 0.75 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures were down 0.88 percent.
