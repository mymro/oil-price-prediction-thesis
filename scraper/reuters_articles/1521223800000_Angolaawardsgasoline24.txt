LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - Angolaâ€™s state oil firm Sonangol awarded its rare refined products buy tender to Glencore and Total, sources familiar with the matter said, cutting out longtime supplier Trafigura. Total will supply gasoline while Glencore will supply the country with diesel. Sonangol issued the tender in January. For years OPEC member Angola relied on commodities trader Trafigura for fuel imports. The trader was still supplying gasoil until now but major competitor Vitol recently edged in to supply the country with gasoline. (Reporting By Libby George and Julia Payne Editing by Susan Fenton)
