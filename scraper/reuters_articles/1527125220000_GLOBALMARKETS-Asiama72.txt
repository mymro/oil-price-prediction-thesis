* Trump says ‘different structure’ needed in U.S.-China trade talks * U.S. Federal Reserve minutes reassure on rate rises * Oil prices flat after Wednesday falls on U.S. inventory build By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, May 24 (Reuters) - Asian shares moved lower on Thursday as investors fretted about new setbacks in U.S.-China trade talks, but negative sentiment was tempered by U.S. Federal Reserve meeting minutes suggesting it would not raise the tempo at which it increases interest rates. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index was 0.6 percent lower. A day after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not pleased with trade talks between the United States and China, he called for “a different structure” in any trade deal. The move added to uncertainty over the negotiations and prompted a fall in stock markets. However, the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s May 1-2 meeting eased market concerns that it would raise interest rates more quickly than expected. The minutes, which were seen as dovish, helped to push U.S. stocks into positive territory on Wednesday. “(The) minutes read largely in line with latest Fedspeak. Consensus finds no major signs of accelerating inflation; wage improvements aren’t broad; drivers of the (workforce) participation rate are still a mystery and the flatter yield curve isn’t flashing red yet,” Citi analysts said in a note.
