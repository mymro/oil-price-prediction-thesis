(Add details) BAGHDAD, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Iraqi oil exports rose to 3.566 million barrels per day (bpd) in July from 3.52 million bpd the previous month, the oil ministry said in a statement. Exports from the southern Basra oilfields reached 3.435 million bpd, up from 3.39 million bpd in June, it said. Shipments from Iraqâ€™s northern Kirkuk oilfields to the Turkish port of Ceyhan averaged 101,000 bpd, the statement said. The average sale price in July was $61.156 per barrel, generating around $6.76 billion in revenue, the ministry said. Iraq is producing below its maximum capacity of nearly 5 million bpd, in line with a production-cutting agreement between OPEC and allies such as Russia which is aimed at supporting prices.
