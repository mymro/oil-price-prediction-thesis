MOSCOW (Reuters) - Germany’s Opal onshore gas link, which connects to the Russian-designed Nord Stream pipeline, has started reducing gas flows after a court ruling, while Nel, another link to the undersea connector, boosted intake, operators’ data showed on Saturday. The data showed that flows via Opal have been reduced by around a quarter from the previous day to 32.76 million kWh/h as of 0700 GMT (3.00 am ET). At the same time, Russian gas giant Gazprom has increased supplies via the Nel pipeline, which also connects to the Nord Stream and feeds northern Germany, to 32.74 million kWh/h, up 12% from Friday. The changes in volumes come after Germany ordered the Gazprom and Wintershall DEA-controlled Opal gas pipeline to stop selling a significant amount of capacity to ship gas from the Nord Stream pipeline to the onshore European grid. On Tuesday, Europe’s top court had overruled an EU decision allowing Gazprom to ship more gas via the pipeline, meaning that Gazprom has to redirect some of its gas flows through other infrastructure.
