NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major world stock markets climbed on Tuesday on hopes of more stimulus for China’s economy, while sterling rebounded from the day’s lows after British lawmakers defeated Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal on withdrawing from the European Union. Sterling rallied more than a cent to stand above $1.28 after the vote. It GBP= was last trading at $1.2875, up 0.09 percent on the day. May’s crushing loss, the first British parliamentary defeat of a treaty since 1864, marks the collapse of her two-year strategy of forging an amicable divorce maintaining close ties to the EU after the March 29 exit. “After the big defeat, which was even larger than what the market had expected, we might getting closer to a no-Brexit scenario. The pound has retraced some of its losses after that vote, which was not unexpected. It may also simply be short-covering,” said Eric Stein, co-director of global income group at Eaton Vance in Boston. “There is still a massive amount of uncertainty for U.K. assets,” he said. U.S. Treasury yields edged higher in choppy trading on expectations for some kind of resolution on Brexit despite the  parliament’s rejection of May’s deal. Helping sentiment on Wall Street, U.S. President Trump talked up chances of a China trade deal and Chinese officials hinted at more stimulus for their slowing economy.
