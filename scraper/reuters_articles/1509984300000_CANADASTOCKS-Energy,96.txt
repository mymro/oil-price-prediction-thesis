Oil and gas companies rallied 1.8 percent as crude prices touched their highest since July 2015 after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman tightened his grip on power with the arrest of royals, ministers and investors. Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest oil exporter. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and other resource firms, rose 1.1 percent, with Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd climbing 2.2 percent to C$57.55. The price of bullion nudged back above $1,270 an ounce on a steadier U.S. dollar and a drop in bond yields.
