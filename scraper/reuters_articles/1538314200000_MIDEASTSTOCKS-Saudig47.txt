The Saudi index closed at 7,999.5 points, the highest level since August 29, with petrochemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries closing 1.5 percent higher and refiner Petro Rabigh up 2.6 percent. Banks also gained with Al Rajhi Bank up nearly 2 percent and Samba Financial Group rising 1.1 percent On Friday Brent crude futures rose $1 to settle at $82.72 a barrel, with the session high of $82.87 the contract’s highest since Nov. 10, 2014. In the third quarter, Brent has gained about 4 percent. “The market was attractive at lower levels with forward PE around 14 times, oil is above $80 now and news on the economy is positive with the government saying they are looking at increasing spending over the next few years,” said Muhammad Faisal Potrik, head of research at Riyad Capital.

A gain of more than 2.2 percent in Industries Qatar lifted Qatari stocks by 0.3 percent.

The Dubai index gained 0.3 percent, helped by a 2.6 percent rise in contractor Arabtec which has been riding high since announcing a 3.2 billion dirham ($871 million) contract earlier this month, won by a consortium involving one of its units. Property firm DAMAC also climbed 2.5 percent ahead of a property show this week where it is expected to showcase new offerings. Abu Dhabi’s index was down 0.3 percent due to weakness in First Abu Dhabi Bank, but Bank of Sharjah closed 1.9 percent higher on merger talk.
