The conglomerate could also invest in Petronas’ Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, said Yu Jeong Joon, chief executive of the conglomerate’s energy arm SK E&S. “In...areas of renewable and petrochemicals, we already have serious discussions. One of our affiliates is already talking (about) potential joint venture into petrochemicals side, into the RAPID complex,” Yu told reporters, speaking on the sidelines of a ceremony for the signing of a broad memorandum of understanding (MoU) between SK Group and Malaysia. RAPID is a $27 billion project located between the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea, conduits for Middle East oil and gas bound for China, Japan and South Korea.
