(Refiles to add dateline) June 5 (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a higher opening for Canada’s main stock index on Tuesday as a rise in copper prices are expected to benefit shares of resource companies. Worries of a potential supply impact of wage negotiations at Chile’s Escondida mine, the world’s biggest copper mine operated by BHP,, lifted copper prices to a six-week high and above $7,000 a tonne. Failure to reach a labour deal at the mine during last year’s wage talks led to a 44-day strike, causing a near 8 percent drop in the mine’s annual output.
