BAGHDAD, Aug 29 (Reuters) - OPEC will discuss in December whether producers can compensate for a sudden drop in Iranian oil supply after U.S sanctions against Tehran start in November, the head of Iraqâ€™s state-oil marketer SOMO, Alaa al-Yasiri, told Reuters on Wednesday. Yasiri said a sudden drop in Iran oil exports will have a negative impact on prices and market fundamentals. Iraq has resumed crude shipments to Iran from its Kirkuk oil fields following a few days stoppage due to logistical issues, he said, adding that so far Iraq had only shipped 500,000 barrels and hopes to ship a total of 1 million before the November sanctions kick in.
