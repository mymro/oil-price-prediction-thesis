NEW YORK (Reuters) - Concerns about an escalating U.S.-China trade war made markets topsy-turvy on Wednesday, with U.S. stocks breaking a four-session winning streak and Brent crude prices seeing their biggest one-day drop in two years. Even so, the U.S. dollar hit a six-month high against the safe-haven Japanese yen as currency traders put trade worries aside and focused on Labor Department data that showed producer prices rising more than expected. Metal prices also slumped after U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat overnight of 10 percent tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods dampened hopes that Washington will eventually step back from the escalating row. The clock now starts ticking on a two-month period of public comment before the levies are imposed. Trump has said he may ultimately target more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.

Riley FBR in New York. “Concerns over trade and trade wars are really having an adverse effect, less so on the U.S. markets than the international markets, but it is certainly taking a bite.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 219.21 points, or 0.88 percent, to 24,700.45, the S&P 500 lost 19.82 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,774.02 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 42.59 points, or 0.55 percent, to 7,716.61. In currencies, both the yen and the dollar act as safe-haven investments. But the strength of the greenback against the yen suggests investors are reflecting faith in the U.S. economy rather than seeking safety. The dollar index rose 0.6 percent, with the euro down 0.59 percent to $1.1673. The Japanese yen weakened 0.92 percent versus the greenback at 112.02 per dollar.
