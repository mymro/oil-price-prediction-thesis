OSAKA (Reuters) - Russia’s government and its oil companies have a unified position on the future of the deal between OPEC and its allies to cut crude output, Interfax and TASS news agencies cited Energy Minister Alexander Novak as saying on Friday. OPEC and non-OPEC oil exporters are due to discuss the future of their output deal in Vienna next week. “Of course we always have a unified position and a consolidated approach,” Interfax quoted Novak as saying on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan’s Osaka.
