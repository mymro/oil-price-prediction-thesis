Aug 29 (Reuters) - Futures for Canada’s main stock index edged up on Thursday, supported by higher U.S. crude prices amid positive comments from China on its trade war with the United States. The two sides are discussing the next round of face-to-face talks scheduled in September, but hopes for progress hinge on whether Washington can create favourable conditions, China’s commerce ministry said.
