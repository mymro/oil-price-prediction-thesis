Dec 10 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s stock market slipped on Tuesday, hurt by losses in banking shares, before Saudi Aramco’s listing. Other major Gulf markets were little changed.

Saudi British Bank fell 2.3% and National Commercial Bank 0.7%. Saudi Aramco has priced its IPO at 32 riyals ($8.53) per share, raising $25.6 billion, more than Alibaba’s $25 billion listing in 2014.

If the greenshoe option is exercised in full the state-controlled oil giant could raise $29.4 billion. Qatar’s index was up 0.2%. Qatar Islamic Bank rose 0.9% and Qatar National Bank 0.4% Qatar is sending its prime minister to an annual summit of Gulf Cooperation Council leaders in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, a sign of a potential thaw in a two-and-a-half-year Gulf dispute.
