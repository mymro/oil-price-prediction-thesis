ABU DHABI (Reuters) - OPEC and its allies are monitoring global oil markets, United Arab Emirates Minister of Energy and Industry Suhail al-Mazrouei said on Wednesday, and conformity levels are the same as previously announced at the last OPEC+ joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting. “When it comes to volumes we are following up; we are committed to adhere to the conformity levels that we announced when we met in Abu Dhabi. No changes there. We are committed to the volumes and the cuts that every country announced,” Mazrouei told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference.
