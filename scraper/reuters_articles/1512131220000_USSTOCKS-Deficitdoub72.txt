* Futures down: Dow 82 pts, S&P 12.5 pts, Nasdaq 48 pts By Sruthi Shankar Dec 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures pointed to a reversal of some of this week’s gains for Wall Street on Friday as a delay in voting on a Republican tax overhaul kept investors on edge about its passage. * Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures pointed to falls of between a third and three-quarters of a percent. * The U.S. Senate debated the bill late into Thursday and adjourned as fiscal conservatives were unsettled about the effect on the deficit of the bill.
