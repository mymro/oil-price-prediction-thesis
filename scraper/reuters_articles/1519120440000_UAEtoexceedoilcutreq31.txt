LONDON (Reuters) - United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui told Reuters on Tuesday that the Gulf OPEC member is expected to over-deliver with its oil production cuts under a global supply pact in the first quarter of this year. Mazroui, who holds the OPEC presidency in 2018, said planned field maintenance and his countryâ€™s full commitment to the pact will help the UAE to reduce oil supply more than is required.
