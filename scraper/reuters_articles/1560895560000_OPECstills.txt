LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC has again proposed to move dates of its next meeting, now suggesting July 1-2, two sources familiar with the matter said, as Saudi Arabia, Iran and non-OPEC Russia are struggling to agree a compromise. Previous proposals included dates for a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries followed by a meeting with non-OPEC allies on June 25-26 and July 11-12. “These are suggestions subject to approval,” one of the sources said. The new suggestion came in a letter from Venezuela, which holds the OPEC presidency, another source said.
