CAIRO, July 13 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco said it was raising domestic gasoline prices on Sunday, with 91 grade reaching 1.53 riyals per litre from 1.44 and 95 grade rising to 2.18 riyals from 2.10. Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant said in a statement that the adjustments were in line with the government’s plans to reform energy and water prices, and that they were subject to changes in global exports prices.
