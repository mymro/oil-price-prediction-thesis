(Corrects paragraph 2 to show shutdown was 2 weeks ago, not this week) DUBAI, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has partially shut its Safaniyah offshore oilfield after a main power cable was cut by a vesselâ€™s anchor, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. The shutdown occurred about two weeks ago, the source said, and it was not immediately clear when the field would be back at full capacity. State oil company Saudi Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Safaniyah is the largest offshore oilfield in the world, with a capacity of more than 1 million barrels per day. Brent crude oil prices hit 2019 highs above $65 per barrel on Friday, spurred by supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the partial shutdown of the Saudi Arabian oilfield. Brent rose as high as $65.10, pushing past the $65 mark for the first time this year, before edging back to $64.77 a barrel by 0612 GMT, up about 0.3 percent from the last close.
