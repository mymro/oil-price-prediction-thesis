ST. PETERSBURG (Reuters) - OPEC began a discussion about easing production cuts following a critical tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump, OPEC’s Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said on Friday. “We pride ourselves as friends of the United States,” Barkindo told a panel with Saudi and Russian energy ministers in St. Petersburg at Russia’s main economic forum. He also said it wasn’t unusual for the United States to put pressure on OPEC as some U.S. energy secretaries had called OPEC and asked to help lower prices in the past.
