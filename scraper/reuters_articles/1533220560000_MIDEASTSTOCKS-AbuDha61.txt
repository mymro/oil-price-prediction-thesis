* Abu Dhabi down as most Gulf exchanges fall * Dana Gas, Taqa down in Abu Dhabi * Aramex jumps 3.5 pct in Dubai DUBAI Aug 2 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi’s stock market fell on Thursday, leading a tumble of most Gulf bourse’s as fears spread of an escalating trade dispute between the United States and China. Analysts blame the retreat in world stock markets on the uncertainty around the trade policy of the Trump administration. Trump said on Wednesday he wants to raise the tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent from a previously proposed 10 percent, later rattling Asian stocks. Abu Dhabi’s benchmark index closed down 0.7 percent, pulled down by financial, telecom and energy stocks.

Energy shares Dana Gas and Abu Dhabi National Energy (TAQA) lost 2.7 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, as oil prices fell for a third day. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have increased production, as agreed at a meeting in June, to help to compensate for an anticipated shortfall in Iranian crude supplies once U.S. sanctions come into force later this year.
