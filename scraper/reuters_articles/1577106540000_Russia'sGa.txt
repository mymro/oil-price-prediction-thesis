MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Gazprom will produce more than 500 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 2019, the Interfax news agency cited the company’s deputy chief executive Vitaly Markelov as saying on Monday. “It will be greater. How much greater, I won’t say. Let a week go by, then we’ll see,” Markelov said.
