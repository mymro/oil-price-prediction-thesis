BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq’s oil production and export rates remain stable, Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban said on Saturday, as the country remained gripped by widespread anti-government protests. “Ghadhban pointed to the stability of production and export rates, and the extractive side was in very good health,” a statement from his ministry read.  The country also remained committed to maintaining its production share in OPEC, the statement said.
