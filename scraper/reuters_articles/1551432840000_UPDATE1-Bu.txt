(Adds details) SOFIA, March 1 (Reuters) - State-owned Bulgarian Energy Holding (BEH) said on Friday it has filed an appeal against an $88 million fine imposed by EU antitrust regulators for blocking rivals’ access to key gas infrastructure in the Balkan country between 2010 and 2015. The European Commission fined BEH 77 million euros ($88 million) in December, saying the company abused its market dominance to hinder competition. BEH’s gas supply unit, Bulgargaz, and its gas network operator, Bulgartransgaz, are also subject to the fine. “BEH and its subsidiaries do not accept the Commission’s findings that they have abused a dominant position on the Bulgarian gas market,” BEH said in a statement. Bulgaria’s government said after the fine was announced in December that the European Commission’s competition enforcer had demanded that, in order to avoid a fine, Bulgaria must sell a majority stake in Bulgartransgaz to a European strategic investor as a guarantee that the market would not be distorted. Bulgaria, which meets all of its gas needs through one route from one supplier - Russia’s Gazprom - said such an option was unacceptable, as its gas pipelines were strategic infrastructure. Sofia plans to keep Bulgargaz and Bulgartransgaz under BEH’s control, which is in line with EU energy rules. Bulgaria is working to diversify its gas routes and suppliers. It also wants to build a new pipeline that is likely to transport mainly Russian gas from the TurkStream pipeline to central Europe, bypassing Ukraine, currently the main transit route for Russian gas to Europe.
