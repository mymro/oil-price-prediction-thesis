Sept 17 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index gave up early losses to trade higher on Tuesday after a rise in the materials sector more than offset a slide in energy shares. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index opened modestly lower after energy shares, hurt by a slide in oil prices, retreated from their biggest jump in nearly 11 years. * At 10:03 a.m. ET (1403 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was up 25.62 points, or 0.15%, at 16,776.93. * The energy sector tumbled 2.5%, a day after surging 9%, as crude prices tumbled after sources told Reuters that Saudi Arabia’s oil output will return faster than first thought following the weekend attacks on production facilities. * Eight of the index’s 11 major sectors were higher, led by the materials sector, which added nearly 2% as gold prices rose. * On the TSX, 128 issues were higher, while 100 issues declined for a 1.28-to-1 ratio favouring gainers, with 15.00 million shares traded. * The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Restaurant Brands, which rose 2.1%.
