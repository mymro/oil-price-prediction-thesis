The FTSE 100 surged 1.1% to a more than two-month high by 0702 GMT and the FTSE 250 added 1%. All sectors on both indexes were trading higher in early dealings. Investors piled into equities, especially that of banks with a heavy presence in Asia such as HSBC and Prudential . Shares of miners, sensitive to news surrounding top metals consumer China, also boosted the main index. Oil majors Shell and BP advanced as crude prices surged after top producers Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iraq backed a plan to extend supply cuts for another six to nine months.
