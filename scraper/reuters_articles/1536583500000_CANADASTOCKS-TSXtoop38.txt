Sept 10 (Reuters) - Futures pointed to a higher opening for Canada’s main stock index on Monday as oil prices rose as U.S. drilling stalled and on anticipation of reduced crude supply as U.S. sanctions on Iranian exports go into effect from November. U.S. energy companies cut oil rigs for the second week in three as the rig count has stagnated over the past three months. U.S. drillers cut two oil rigs last week, bringing the total count to 860, Baker Hughes said on Friday. The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has stalled since May, reflecting increases in well productivity but also bottlenecks and infrastructure constraints.
