* Dow and S&P futures flat, Nasdaq up 0.15 pct By Medha Singh May 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stock market futures steadied on Friday, helped by a measured response by North Korea to President Donald Trump’s cancelling of a planned summit, while a slump in oil prices pressured energy stocks. North Korea said it was still open to talks with the United States, saying it hoped the “Trump formula” could resolve the standoff over its nuclear weapons program. The three main U.S. indexes ended only slightly lower on Thursday, recovering from what market participants said was a knee-jerk reaction to the cancelling of the summit. Energy stocks were weighed down by a more than 2 percent drop in oil prices after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they were ready to ease supply curbs that have pushed prices to their highest since 2014. Shares of Exxon Mobil dipped 1.0 percent in premarket trading, while Chevron was off 1.0 percent. The S&P energy index ended down 1.7 percent on Thursday. At 7:30 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 6 points, or 0.02 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 0.5 points, or 0.02 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 10.75 points, or 0.15 percent.
