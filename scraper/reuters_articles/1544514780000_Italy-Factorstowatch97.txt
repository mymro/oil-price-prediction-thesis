Some Generali shareholders, including Francesco Caltagirone, have sent a letter to the board asking for a change in the company’s by-laws to allow the appointment of a chairman over the age of 70, according to Il Sole 24 Ore. This change would make it possible to confirm Chairman Gabriele Galateri di Genola in his job. The chairman of Compagnia di Sanpaolo, the lender’s biggest shareholder, told Il Sole 24 Ore that he was in favor of making the lender’s board more international.
