DUBAI/LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - An OPEC+ technical panel has agreed to recommend a provisional additional cut in oil output of 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) as it awaits the final position of Russia on the proposal, two OPEC+ sources said on Thursday. “The recommendation is for a cut of 600,000 bpd. Russia has asked for more time for consultations,” one of the sources said. The OPEC+ ministers have yet to decide on whether to bring forward their upcoming policy meeting to February from early March, the sources said.
