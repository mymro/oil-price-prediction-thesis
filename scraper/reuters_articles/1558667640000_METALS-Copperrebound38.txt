SINGAPORE, May 24 (Reuters) - Copper prices rebounded on Friday from their lowest since Jan. 14 hit in the previous session, as the U.S. dollar eased, but were heading for their sixth straight week of losses on a prolonged U.S.-China trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday Huawei could be included in the U.S.-China trade deal after last week banned U.S. firms from doing business with the Chinese company, which is the world’s largest telecoms network gear maker. The metals market gained some support as the dollar fell from a two-year high overnight and was largely unchanged on Friday, on fears that a trade war with China will hurt the U.S. economy more than expected and on expectations of a rate cut. A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated metals cheaper to imports using other currencies. * Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 0.4% to $5,950.50 a tonne by 0155 GMT, while the most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange advanced 0.4% to 46,980 yuan ($6,798.25) a tonne. * London aluminium rose 0.5%, nickel increased 0.3%, zinc edged up 0.2%, and lead was 0.6% higher. * Shanghai aluminium rose 0.5%, nickel eased 0.1% and zinc dropped as much as 1.9% to its lowest since Jan. 18 at 20,000 yuan a tonne. * Chile’s SQM, the world’s No. 2 producer of lithium, said it would delay a key expansion of production capacity from the Atacama salt flat until the end of 2021 amid a slump in prices for the coveted battery metal. * For the top stories in metals and other news, click or * Asian shares hobbled near four-month lows and crude oil plunged on worries the U.S.-China trade spat was developing into a more entrenched strategic dispute between the world’s two largest economies, pushing investors to safe-haven assets. 0830   UK      Retail Sales MM YY       April 0830   UK      Retail Sales Ex-Fuel MM  April 1200   Brazil  IPCA-15 Mid-Month CPI    May 1230   US      Durable Goods            April 1300   Russia  Unemployment Rate        April Three month LME copper Most active ShFE copper Three month LME aluminium Most active ShFE aluminium Three month LME zinc Most active ShFE zinc Three month LME lead Most active ShFE lead Three month LME nickel Most active ShFE nickel Three month LME tin Most active ShFE tin ARBS ($1 = 6.9106 Chinese yuan renminbi)
