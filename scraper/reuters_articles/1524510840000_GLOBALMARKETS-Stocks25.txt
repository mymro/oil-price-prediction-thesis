* U.S. earnings season heats up with major tech names on tap * Treasury yields near 3 pct rattle stocks, underpin dollar * Aluminium tumbles as U.S. mulls Rusal sanctions reprieve (Updates with European market close) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, April 23 (Reuters) - A gauge of global equity markets retreated on Monday as U.S. bond yields moved closer to the 3 percent level that has unnerved investors in recent months and a fall in commodity prices pressured materials stocks. U.S. bond prices fell, with the 10-year yield hitting its highest in over four years amid worries about the growing supply of government debt and accelerating inflation as oil and commodity prices have been rising in recent weeks. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.977 percent, from 2.951 percent late on Friday. “There are supply concerns. The auction sizes are getting bigger,” said Larry Milstein, head of agency and government trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. in New York. Commodities came under pressure after the U.S. mulled sanctions relief for United Company Rusal Plc as it weighed the potential impact of such measures on American allies and partners. Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange, which hit a seven-year high on Thursday, were last down 8.7 percent at $2,254.50 a tonne. Shares of aluminum company Alcoa tumbled 14.01 percent. Spot gold dropped 0.8 percent to $1,323.79 an ounce. In equity markets, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.35 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.35 percent. The climb in debt yields helped push the U.S. dollar to a seven-week high to put additional pressure on commodities and sent the euro and yen lower. The dollar index rose 0.68 percent, with the euro down 0.66 percent to $1.2205. The Japanese yen weakened 0.89 percent versus the greenback at 108.64 per dollar. Oil prices were volatile, as crude recovered from earlier losses as investors juggled downward pressure after Iran squashed hopes that OPEC would extend its production cap pact and support on fears U.S. sanctions could dampen Iran’s output. U.S. crude rose 0.09 percent to $68.46 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.52, up 0.62 percent on the day.
