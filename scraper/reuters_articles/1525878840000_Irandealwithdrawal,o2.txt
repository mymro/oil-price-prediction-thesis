(Reuters) - Oil prices are at risk for further gains due to the United States’ decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, coupled with rising tensions in other oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, Goldman Sachs said in a note Wednesday. The investment bank’s current forecast is for Brent crude to hit $82.50 a barrel by the summer; it is currently trading around $77 a barrel. The harsher approach by the United States could result in an initial loss of about 500,000 barrels a day (bpd) in Iran’s output, which is currently 3.8 million bpd. Such a loss would boost oil prices by about $6.20 per barrel, Goldman said. “Such elevated oil geopolitical risks exacerbate the upside risks to Brent forecasts and reinforce our view that oil price volatility will continue to increase,” they wrote.
