KIEV, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Ukraineâ€™s state energy firm Naftogaz and Russian gas giant Gazprom agreed to continue working on options for continuing the transit through Ukraine, a senior Naftogaz official said on Friday. Yuriy Vitrenko said on Facebook that it was too early to talk about a draft agreement. The current transit deal expires at the end of this year.
