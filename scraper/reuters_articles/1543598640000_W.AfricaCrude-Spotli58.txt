LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Spot activity was limited as buying interest from independent Chinese refiners was thin due to uncertainty over allocations for next year and the recent crash in global oil prices. * Angola’s state firm Sonangol has four January cargoes left. It was offering Gindungo at dated Brent minus 10 cents a barrel, Olombendo at dated Brent plus 10 cents, Pazflor at dated Brent minus 20 cents and Saturno at dated Brent minus 60 cents. * Sonangol has already sold two spot cargoes, a Dalia and a Girassol. The Girassol was initially offered around dated Brent plus $1.60 a barrel, but this level was dropped twice with dated Brent plus $1.25 being the last offer before it sold. * Nigeria’s MRS awarded a sell tender this week for a cargo each of Agbami and Escravos both loading Jan. 20-21. Chevron won the cargo of Escravos, traders said. The cargo of Agbami loading the same date was thought to have gone to Litasco. *India’s IOC issued a tender for Feb. 1-10 loading. It closes on Dec. 5. *Indonesia’s Pertamina is seeking between 950,000 and 1.9 million barrels of light sweet crude for delivery in early February in a tender that will be awarded on Tuesday, traders said. * OPEC oil supply fell in November from a two-year high due to U.S. sanctions on Iran, a Reuters survey found, although most of the output gap left by Iran was plugged by Saudi Arabia and the UAE in response to calls from U.S. President Donald Trump.
