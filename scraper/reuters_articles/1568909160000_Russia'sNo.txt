BRUSSELS, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday that he had spoken to his Saudi Arabian counterpart on Wednesday and that no decision had been taken to change a global oil deal between OPEC and its allies. Speaking in Brussels, Novak said that the situation had stabilised following a weekend attack on Saudi oil infrastructure and that oil markets were calmer now than they had been on Monday.
