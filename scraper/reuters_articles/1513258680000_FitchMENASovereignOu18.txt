(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: Fitch 2018 Outlook: Middle East and North Africa Sovereigns here HONG KONG, December 14 (Fitch) Heightened geopolitical risks in the once-stable Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), combined with the inability of some oil exporters to adjust their budgets to a new oil price reality, result in a negative 2018 outlook for sovereign ratings in Middle East North Africa (MENA), Fitch Ratings says in a new report. Three of the 13 MENA sovereigns rated by Fitch (more than 20%) are on a Negative Outlook. None are on a Positive Outlook. Budget deficits will persist across the GCC and will stay in double digits in Bahrain and Oman, despite the oil price recovery. For the majority of sovereigns, fiscal break-even oil prices are still considerably above current or expected actual oil price levels. This is resulting in worsening sovereign debt and external asset ratios. We expect gross foreign and local market GCC issuance of USD110 billion in 2018, in tandem with drawdowns of around USD50 billion from wealth funds and external reserves. Price reforms have been scaled down and delayed in some parts of the GCC. Only Saudi Arabia and the UAE have introduced excise tax and are likely to implement VAT at the beginning of 2018. Implementation of taxation, privatisation and broader public-sector reform is taking time, even as the potential for spending cuts is being exhausted. In the rest of the MENA, we expect a mixed scorecard for fiscal and structural reforms. IMF programmes are helping to varying degrees in Egypt, Iraq and Tunisia, but political risks, fragile economic performance and governance weaknesses continue to act as constraints on economic reform. We expect growth to firm in a number of countries but to generally remain subdued owing to limited structural reform, political risk and still relatively low oil prices. We expect growth of 4%-5% in Egypt and Ras Al Khaimah and around 3% in Israel and Morocco, but elsewhere we project growth closer to 2% or below. The GCC has lost some of its reputation for stability and predictability in a troubled region. We do not expect an imminent resolution of the Saudi/UAE dispute with Qatar. Saudi Arabia's increasingly assertive foreign policy under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is contributing to heightened tensions with Iran, while the threat remains of domestic challenges to his consolidation of power and reforms. Political risk has been a persistent feature of Fitch's ratings of GCC sovereigns, but further shocks remain a significant risk factor in 2018. Regional and domestic political developments pose a downside risk to ratings in 2018. A weaker commitment to fiscal consolidation would put pressure on ratings, particularly for sovereigns with large deficits. Reforms to strengthen the business environment and private sector could lead to positive rating actions. Substantial oil price deviation from our baseline forecast could have an impact on ratings, for both oil exporters and oil importers.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.
