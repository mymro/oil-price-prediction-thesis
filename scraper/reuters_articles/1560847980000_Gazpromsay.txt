MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian natural gas producer Gazprom said on Tuesday that U.S. liquefied natural gas was not currently replacing Russian gas on European markets. The United States has become the world’s fastest growing exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and is set to become the world’s third-largest shipper of the product this year, due to surging output from U.S. shale fields.
