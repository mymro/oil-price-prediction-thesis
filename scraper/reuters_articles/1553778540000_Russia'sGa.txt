MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Gazprom Neft does not expect the global deal to cut oil output will last long and does not take it into account in its long-term planning, CEO Alexander Dyukov said on Thursday. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other non-OPEC producers - an alliance known as OPEC+ - agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1 for six months. Gazprom Neft plans to increase or at least maintain hydrocarbon production at 100 million tonnes per year after 2020, Dyukov said. “We set the task of being better than the market and growing faster than the market,” he added. Gazprom Neft is the oil arm of Russian gas giant Gazprom.
