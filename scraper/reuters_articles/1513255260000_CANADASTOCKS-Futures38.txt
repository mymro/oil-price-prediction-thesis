Dec 14 (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a slightly lower opening for Canada’s main stock index on Thursday, a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates and ahead of key central banks in Europe making their own rate announcements. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are due to announce their final policy decisions of the year later in the day, with both expected to keep benchmark rates on hold. The Fed, after raising rates for the third time this year, kept its outlook unchanged for coming years even as it projected faster economic growth from the Republican tax overhaul plan.
