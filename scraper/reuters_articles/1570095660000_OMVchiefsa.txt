ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) - There is no need to discuss alternative routes for Gazprom’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is still awaiting approval for its Danish leg, the chief executive of Austria’s OMV said on Thursday. The pipeline is already under construction and has almost reached the Danish border, but Denmark has yet to give its go-ahead for the scheme. “I am very much convinced that we do not need to discuss any alternative routes in Nord Stream 2 company, because I am convinced... that we have a good chance to get the permit in Denmark,” Rainer Seele told reporters. “If they tell me that the probability is very low that we will get a permit then I will start thinking.” OMV is one of the backers of the project, along with Shell, France’s Engie, Germany’s Uniper and BASF unit Wintershall. Russian gas exporter Gazprom is leading the project.
