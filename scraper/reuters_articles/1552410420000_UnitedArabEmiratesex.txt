HOUSTON (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates in February exceeded its OPEC target for oil production cuts, achieving 119 percent of its goal, the countryâ€™s energy minister said on Tuesday at an energy conference.  Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said he met with financial executive attending the CERAWeek energy conference to discuss the challenges for financing oil and gas production. OPEC and its allies have instituted production cuts in an effort to shrink global oil stocks and prop up crude prices.
