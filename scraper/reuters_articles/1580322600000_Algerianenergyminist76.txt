CAIRO (Reuters) - Algeria’s energy minister Mohamed Arkab said on Wednesday it was “very possible that Opec+ meeting could be advanced to February instead of scheduled meeting in March,” state press agency reported. When asked about extending the Opec+ output-cutting deal, Arkab added: “everything is possible”. Arkab, when asked about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on oil prices, said: “We are now in discussions with OPEC countries, and a decision will be made in the coming days”.
