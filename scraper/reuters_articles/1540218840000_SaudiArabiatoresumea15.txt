DUBAI, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia ordered the resumption of annual bonus payments to all state employees from the start of 2019, Civil Service Minister Sulaiman Al-Hamdan told Al Arabiya TV on Monday. Riyadh, squeezed by low oil prices, removed the perk - equivalent to a monthâ€™s salary - in September 2016. It restored the payment to some civil servants in April 2017.
