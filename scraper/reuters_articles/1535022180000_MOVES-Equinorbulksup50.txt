SINGAPORE, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Norwegian oil major Equinor said on Thursday it has hired two crude oil traders in Singapore to form a four-man team as it steps up trading and oil marketing in Asia. “We can confirm that Equinor has hired Chen Fei Fan and Chung Chong Min to become part of our 4-man team in Singapore led by Ragnar Bulie,” Equinor spokesman Sverre Olden Mala said in an e-mail. Beijing-based Chen will be leaving Sinochem Corp to join Equinor in September, three industry sources said. Chung, formerly a derivatives trader at South Korea’s SK Energy, joined Equinor recently, they said. Equinor trades in crude oil produced in the Middle East and Russia as well as markets its oil produced in Europe, Africa and the United States to refiners in Asia. Sinochem did not respond to a request for comment.
