MOSCOW (Reuters) - Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of Russian gas producer Gazprom, on Thursday reported a 48.7 percent jump in 2018 net profit to 376.7 billion roubles ($5.8 billion) buoyed by higher prices and output.

It reiterated a hydrocarbon production target of 100 million tonnes of oil equivalent by 2020 and expects oil prices of around $60 per barrel through to 2030 in its base scenario.
