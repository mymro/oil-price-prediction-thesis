March 19 (Reuters) - Futures pointed to a higher opening for Canada’s main stock index on Tuesday as crude prices rose, supported by OPEC supply cuts. June futures on the S&P/TSX index were up 0.29 percent at 7:05 a.m. ET. Canada’s Finance Minister Bill Morneau is expected to unveil a stimulus-filled federal budget, the last budget ahead of the federal election in October. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting also begins on Tuesday. The Toronto Stock Exchange S&P/TSX composite index closed up 111.02 points, or 0.69 percent, at 16,251.37 on Monday.

The Canadian oil-producing province of Alberta will increase crude production limits by 25,000 barrels per day in May and a further 25,000 bpd in June, the government said on Monday.
