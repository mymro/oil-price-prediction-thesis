The FTSE 250 , which hit successive record highs last week, shed 0.1% at the beginning of another holiday-shortened week. Healthcare stocks AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline were the biggest drags on the blue-chip bourse. Oil majors Shell and BP also weighed, despite crude prices touching a three-month high.
