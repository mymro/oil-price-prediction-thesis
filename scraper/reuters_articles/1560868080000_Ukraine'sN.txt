KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian energy company Naftogaz has proposed a contract for gas swaps to Russian gas giant Gazprom instead of direct transit, a senior Naftogaz official said on Tuesday. Yuriy Vitrenko wrote on social media that under the proposed deal Gazprom could sell its gas to Naftogaz at the Russia - Ukraine border, while Kiev would sell the same amount to Europe at the Ukraine - European Union border crossing.
