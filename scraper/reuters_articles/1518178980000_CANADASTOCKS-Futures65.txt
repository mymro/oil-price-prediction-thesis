Feb 9 (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a lower opening for Canada’s main stock index on Friday as investors awaited monthly jobs data, a week after a similar U.S. report sparked a week-long sell off. However, compared with a strong U.S. jobs market, Canadian employment growth is expected to have slowed in January, the report due at 8:30 a.m. ET is expected to show. Economists polled by Reuters expected that just 10,000 jobs were created last month, with the unemployment rate forecast to have increased 5.8 percent. March futures on the S&P TSX index were down 0.34 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET.
