LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Angola crude oil cargoes are slowly finding buyers while offers of Nigerian crude were heard to be steady, traders said on Friday. * The market has around 12 January cargoes available, down two from Thursday’s estimate and still a sizeable overhang given that next month’s programmes will be out in just over a week. * Weaker demand means that traded differentials are lower month-on-month. Unsold cargoes include Cabinda, CLOV, Pazflor and Saturno. * Qua Iboe was being offered at dated Brent plus $1.65 a barrel, a trader said, steady from indications on Thursday.
