MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom will make the bulk of payments to Turkey as part of a gas discount deal in the near future, a company official said on Wednesday. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday Turkey and Russia had reached a retroactive agreement for a 10.25 percent discount on the natural gas Ankara buys from Moscow, which will also pay $1 billion as part of the deal. The Gazprom official said a smaller part of the payments will be made in the form of a price discount.
