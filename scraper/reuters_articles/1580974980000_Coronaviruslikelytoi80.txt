ABERDEEN (Reuters) - The new coronavirus in mainland China, which has killed more than 500 people in the country since the start of the year, could have a significant impact on oil demand in the next two months, French major Total’s CEO said on Thursday. “There will be a possible impact (on oil markets) in the next two months that might be substantial, China will reduce its consumption,” Patrick Pouyanne said during a news conference. The Brent benchmark has lost more than 9% over the last two weeks.
