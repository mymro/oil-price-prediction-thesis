(Refiles for typo in second paragraph) January 29 (Reuters) - Futures in Canada’s main stock index rose on Wednesday, as oil prices advanced on talks that OPEC could extend output curbs to counter a potential drop in demand due to China’s coronavirus outbreak. OPEC sources said the oil cartel wants to extend production cuts until at least June from March and may deepen the reductions, should demand in China drop significantly. Separately, data showed a decline in U.S. crude oil inventories. March futures on the S&P/TSX index were up 0.23% at 7:00 a.m. ET.
