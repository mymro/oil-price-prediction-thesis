SINGAPORE, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum (QP) has informed some term crude buyers in Asia this week that it plans to change the way it prices its oil early next year, sources with knowledge with the matter said on Thursday. The producer currently prices two of its grades - Qatar Land and Qatar Marine - on a retroactive basis and this will be moved to forward pricing to align its prices with other Middle East producers such as Saudi Arabia, they said. QP is targeting to implement the price change in first quarter, two of the sources said. The company could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by Shu Zhang; Editing by Jon Boyle)
