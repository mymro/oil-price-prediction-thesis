KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine’s state energy firm Naftogaz on Wednesday said a Swedish court had rejected an appeal by Russia’s Gazprom against a decision in one of several long-running legal disputes over gas contracts. Naftogaz had secured a favorable decision in December 2017 on its demands that the price of Russian gas to Ukrainian consumers be reduced and the take-or-pay requirement be canceled. Wednesday’s decision comes as the two companies are also negotiating gas supply talks to replace an existing deal that expires at the end of 2019.
