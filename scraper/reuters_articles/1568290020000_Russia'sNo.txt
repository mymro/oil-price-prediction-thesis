MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday the decision by Europe’s top court to curtail Gazprom’s (GAZP.MM) access to Nord Stream pipeline link Opal would affect next week’s gas talks with the European Union and Ukraine. “I think that, in terms of negotiations, this situation will be taken into account,” he said in an interview with Russia’s state-run Rossiya 24 TV channel. Novak also said OPEC and non-OPEC countries did not discuss the possibility of a further extension of their output cut deal. “It has not been discussed yet ... It’s premature, the situation on the market may change,” he said.
