Global worries included the growing international pressure on Saudi Arabia over the death of Jamal Khashoggi. Adding to the air of tension police intercepted suspected bombs mailed to former U.S. President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other high-profile Democrats, as well as to CNN, in what New York officials branded an act of terrorism. Weak readings on manufacturing in Europe added to angst over world growth, as did a surprise slump in U.S. home sales which suggested rising mortgage rates were sapping demand for housing.
