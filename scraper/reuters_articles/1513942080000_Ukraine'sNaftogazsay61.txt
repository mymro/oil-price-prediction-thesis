KIEV, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Ukrainian state-owned energy firm Naftogaz on Friday said a Stockholm court had ruled in its favour on all points of a gas sale arbitration case against Russia’s Gazprom. “(The) tribunal completely rejects Gazprom take-or-pay claims to Naftogaz amounting to $56 billion for 2012-2017,” Naftogaz said in an emailed statement. It also said the price it owed for gas supplied by Gazprom in the second quarter of 2014 had been reduced to $352 per thousand cubic metres (tcm) from $485 tcm.
