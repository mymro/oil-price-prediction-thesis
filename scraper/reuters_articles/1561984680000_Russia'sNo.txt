VIENNA, July 1 (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday that all OPEC and non-OPEC countries favoured extending their global oil output deal by nine months under the same terms agreed in December. “Everyone supported the general proposal to extend by nine months. The OPEC meeting will happen today where these proposals will be looked at. The JMMC recommended specifically this option for further cooperation,” Novak told reporters.
