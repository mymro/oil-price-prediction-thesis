VIENNA, June 22 (Reuters) - The head of Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) confirmed on Friday that Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) had regained control of the key oil ports of Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, saying he hoped operations would resume in the “next couple of days”. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said Libya had been losing 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of production after clashes between the LNA and rival factions closed the two terminals. A minor fire that broke out at a third storage tank in Ras Lanuf on Thursday had been extinguished and the situation was good, he told reporters ahead of an OPEC meeting in Vienna.
