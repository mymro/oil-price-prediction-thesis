Oil prices fell 4 percent after reports of swelling inventories and forecasts of record U.S. and Russian output combined with a sharp sell-off in stock markets as the outlook for global growth deteriorated.

Egypt’s blue-chip index fell 0.7 percent, mirroring a slide in emerging markets generally. Banks continued to decline with Egypt’s largest lender, Commercial International Bank, shedding 0.6 percent. Arab Cotton Ginning lost 3.0 percent after its first-quarter profit dropped over 96 percent. Global Telecom added 4.4 percent while Telecom Egypt climbed 3.3 percent, continuing to surge after saying on Monday it expects revenue growth in the mid-to high single digits in 2019. The firm also expects 2018 revenue to beat guidance. The Abu Dhabi index slipped 0.8 percent with First Abu Dhabi Bank, the United Arab Emirates’ biggest lender, falling 1.3 percent.
