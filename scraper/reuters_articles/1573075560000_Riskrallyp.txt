NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar slid and the three-day global stock market rally paused on Wednesday as U.S. productivity data disappointed and investors turned a bit cautious about U.S.-China trade talks.

U.S. Government data showed American workers were unexpectedly less productive during the third quarter.

France’s benchmark 10-year bond yield FR10YT-RR turned positive for the first time since July, a further sign that pessimism is abating in world bond markets. Investors said lingering concerns about the U.S.-China trade talks had stock markets consolidating gains made recently. “What you saw over the last two days is a bit of confusion on the China phase one deal ... and that started affecting risk appetite,” said Juan Perez, a senior currency trader at Tempus Inc in Washington. Traders and investors hope a preliminary deal will roll back at least some of the punitive tariffs Washington and Beijing have imposed on each other’s goods.

The U.S. Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, fell at a 0.3% annualized rate in the third quarter, the biggest decline in almost four years. But data in Europe showed signs of economic improvement, suggesting sluggish to no-growth had troughed. German industrial orders rose more than expected in September, offering some hope for manufacturers in Europe’s biggest economy after a tough spell. Euro zone business activity expanded slightly faster than expected last month but remained close to stagnation, according to a survey.
