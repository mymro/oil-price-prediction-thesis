MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said time is needed to assess any impact on oil markets from a new coronavirus, Russiaâ€™s Interfax news agency reported on Thursday. Novak also said that Russia was not yet ready to announce its position on OPEC+ action in relation to the coronavirus outbreak and it was premature to talk about any decision. An OPEC+ technical committee is holding consultations in Vienna. While this is not a decision-making body, it does advise the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, led by Russia.
