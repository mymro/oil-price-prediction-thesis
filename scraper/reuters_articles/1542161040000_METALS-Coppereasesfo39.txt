SINGAPORE, Nov 14 (Reuters) - London three-month copper prices edged down on Wednesday as disappointing Chinese credit growth capped a short rally on optimism over U.S.-China trade talks.

Kudlow said “it’s pretty clear now” that Trump will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 industrialized nations meeting in Argentina later this month.
