MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday that Moscow was open to new dates for a meeting of OPEC+ nations, including on July 12, Russian news agencies reported. Novak was cited as saying that he had not yet discussed a change in meeting dates with his Saudi counterpart. An OPEC+ meeting was originally planned for June 26, but Novak has spoken previously of a move to switch it to early July. However, Iranâ€™s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh has proposed meeting from July 10-12 instead.
