LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) has no intention to change its plans to invest in the Middle East, Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said on Wednesday “We have absolutely no intention to change our attitude and appetite for investing in the Middle East. Far from it,” van Beurden told the Oil & Money conference. Shell pulled out of the Majnoon oilfield in Iraq two years ago and earlier this year sold its stake in a refinery in Saudi Arabia. It is a major investor in Qatar and Oman.
