MOSCOW, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Urals differentials to dated Brent eased further in northwest Europe on Friday as September cargoes traded at weaker prices due to sluggish demand. * A number of Urals cargoes loading from Baltic ports in September were on sale, but buying interest was somewhat low, traders said. * Urals refinery margins improved slightly to $1.60 per barrel, but remained weak compared to the average for this year of $3.29 per barrel, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. * Trading firm Glencore sold 100,000 tonnes of Urals loading from Primorsk on Sept. 19-23 at dated Brent minus $2.20 per barrel to France’s Total. The level was 20 cents per barrel lower than recent estimates. * Austria’s OMV offered 85,000 tonnes of CPC Blend loading from Yuzhnaya Ozereyevka on Sept. 23-27 at dated Brent minus $1.15 per barrel, but failed to place the cargo and withdrew. * There were no bids or offers for Urals crude loading from the Black Sea’s Novorossiisk or Azeri BTC, traders said. * Oil producers and their suppliers are cutting budgets, staff and production goals amid a growing consensus of forecasts that oil and gas prices will stay low for several years. * Oil major BP plans to sell more U.S. crude to Asia as its shale oil production grows, seeking to capitalise on growth in the world’s key demand region.
