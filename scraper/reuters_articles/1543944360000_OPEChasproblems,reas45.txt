GENEVA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - OPEC has problems, and the reasons for Qatarâ€™s exit from the organisation must be examined, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Tuesday, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). Qatar said on Monday it will quit OPEC to focus on gas in a swipe at Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the oil exporting group which is trying to show unity in tackling an oil price slide.
