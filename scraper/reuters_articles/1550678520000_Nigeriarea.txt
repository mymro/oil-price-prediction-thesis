ABUJA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Nigeria is willing to reduce oil output to help secure higher prices, the spokesman for President Muhammadu Buhari said in a statement on Wednesday, after an envoy from Saudi Arabia called on the African nation to adhere to a deal on production cuts. The president told the visiting Saudi envoy that “Nigeria was willing to go along with the Saudi initiative in limiting output so that prices would go up,” the presidential spokesman said. Buhari added: “We will cooperate.” Nigeria, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is party to a deal to curb output to support prices, although OPEC data showed its output rose in January.
