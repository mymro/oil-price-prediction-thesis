NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of world stock markets was flat on Wednesday as U.S. data that raised concerns about a slowing economy was offset by a solid start to earnings season, while sterling was volatile as negotiations on a Brexit deal continued.  European stocks pulled back slightly from their strongest closing high in more than a year as clashing headlines on Britain’s last-minute efforts to forge a divorce deal with the European Union left investors hanging on the outcome. On Wall Street, stocks retreated after monthly retail sales data for September showed a decline for the first time in seven months, raising concerns that softness in the manufacturing sector was starting to spread to the broader economy. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS traded at break-even. “Retail sales were definitely on the weaker side and given that the consumer is one of the key pillars holding up the U.S. economy, any weakness in consumer indicators is obviously a sign of concern,” said Ellen Hazen, portfolio manager F.L. Putnam in Wellesley, Massachusetts.  Data later in the session showed U.S. business inventories were unexpectedly flat in August, which suggested inventory investment could also drag on third-quarter economic growth.  Concerns about the trade dispute between the United States and China also weighed. The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed legislation related to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, prompting China to warn in response that bilateral relations would be damaged if the measures became law. Losses were offset by a solid start to earnings season. Bank of America (BAC.N) shares rose 1.98% following its quarterly results. Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to show a decline of 3% for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data, down from 5.1% growth expected at the start of the year. Excluding energy, the growth rate is a negative 0.7%. “They legitimately are coming in better than expected so far, not by leaps and bounds, but incrementally, yes they are. This is not just expectations having been set really low, at least from the earnings estimate standpoint,” said Hazen. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 22.82 points, or 0.08%, to 27,001.98. The S&P 500 .SPX lost 5.99 points, or 0.20%, to 2,989.69 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 24.52 points, or 0.3%, to 8,124.18.

In emerging markets, Turkey’s Halkbank (HALKB.IS) saw its shares drop 4.1% after U.S. prosecutors charged the state-owned lender with taking part in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran, which the company said were part of sanctions leveled against Ankara over its military operation in Syria.
