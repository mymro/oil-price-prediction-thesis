RIYADH (Reuters) - Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that President Vladimir Putin had discussed oil prices with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “A substantial exchange of opinions took place, on regional problems, on situation at the energy markets, or on oil prices, to keep it simple,” he told reporters in Riyadh during Putin’s first visit to Saudi Arabia in over a decade.
