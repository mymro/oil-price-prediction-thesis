WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will allow non-proliferation civil nuclear projects at Arak, Bushehr and Fordow in Iran “under the strictest scrutiny,” the State Department said on Monday, as the country began reimposing strict sanctions on Iran. The United States is restoring sanctions on Iran’s oil, banking and transport sectors, in an effort to end Tehran’s missile and nuclear programs and diminish the country’s influence in the Middle East. The State Department said it will not issue waivers for any new civil nuclear projects.
