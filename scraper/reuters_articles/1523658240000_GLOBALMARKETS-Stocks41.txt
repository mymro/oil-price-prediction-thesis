NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices extended recent gains and a gauge of global stocks eased on Friday as concern over a broader conflict in Syria left investors nervous, while U.S. bank shares led Wall Street lower. The State Department said on Friday that it had proof that Syria carried out a recent chemical weapons attack in the town of Douma. The prospect of Western military action in Syria that could lead to confrontation with Russia hung over the Middle East. Oil prices added to recent gains that drove them to highs not seen since late 2014 and posted their biggest weekly gain since July. “The geopolitical jitters just keep getting priced in here more and more, as we get closer to the moment of the strikes, if there are any,” said John Kilduff, partner at hedge fund Again Capital Management. He noted that Syria poses a large risk to global stability because of its relationship with powerful oil producers. On Wall Street, fear of broader conflict in Syria further unnerved investors, while financial stocks led the day’s declines. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) were down 2.7 percent after its earnings missed estimates, while Citigroup (C.N) dropped 1.6 percent despite beating profit estimates. An S&P 500 index of bank stocks .SPXBK fell 2.6 percent. Weak loan growth weighed on bank shares, said RJ Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. “If you didn’t own financials going into the quarter, there was nothing in the numbers today that would make you excited about owning them,” Grant said. The banks’ results kicked off the U.S. earnings reporting period. Tax cuts are expected to help corporate America post its biggest quarterly profit growth in seven years.
