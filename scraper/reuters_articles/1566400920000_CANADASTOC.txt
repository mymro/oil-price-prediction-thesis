(Updates prices, adds background) Aug 21 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index rose on Wednesday, rebounding from the previous session’s weak close, as a 2% rise in oil prices helped push energy shares higher. * The energy sector climbed 1.1%, leading gains on the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index which was up 65.81 points, or 0.41%, at 16,279.12. * Six of the index’s 11 major sectors were higher. * Crude oil futures rose after industry data showed a larger than expected drop in U.S. crude inventories, but gains were capped by lingering worries about a possible global recession. * U.S. crude prices were up 1.4%, while Brent crude added 2%. * The financial sector gained 0.5% and the industrials sector rose 0.4%. * The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 0.1% as gold eased to hold around the $1,500 level as investors cashed in some gains ahead of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s last meeting. * Data showed Canada’s annual inflation rate held steady in July at 2% because of lower costs for services, including telecoms, that were offset by higher prices for durable goods. * Among stocks, Canada’s Pembina Pipeline Corp fell 0.6% after it agreed to buy smaller rival Kinder Morgan Canada and the U.S. portion of the Cochin pipeline for C$4.35 billion. Shares of Kinder Morgan surged about 35%. * On the TSX, 154 issues were higher, while 73 issues declined for a 2.11-to-1 ratio favouring gainers, with 19.20 million shares traded. * The top percentage gainers on the TSX were Bausch Health Co, which jumped 3.4% followed by shares of MEG Energy Corp, which rose 3.2%. * Alacer Gold Corp fell 2.5%, the most on the TSX, followed by second biggest decliner Ero Copper Corp, which dropped 1.8%. * The most heavily traded shares by volume were Manulife Financial, Sun Life Financial and Cenovus Energy. * The TSX posted two new 52-week highs and one new low. * Across all Canadian issues there were 11 new 52-week highs and five new lows, with total volume of 28.04 million shares.
