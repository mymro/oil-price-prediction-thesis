ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Bahrainâ€™s oil minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa al-Khalifa, said on Tuesday he sees no reason why the supply cut agreement between oil producing countries should not be extended on Nov. 30. He was speaking to reporters in Abu Dhabi on the sidelines of an energy conference. OPEC and other non-OPEC producers will meet on Nov. 30 in Vienna to decide on oil output policy.
