(Recasts, adds background) MOSCOW, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russian oil producer Gazprom Neft said on Thursday it had almost doubled year-on-year net profit in the second quarter to 96.8 billion roubles ($1.5 billion) on higher oil prices and rising production from new projects. Gazprom Neft’s second-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose to 193.1 billion roubles, from 114.4 billion roubles in the same period last year. Second-quarter sales totalled 617.1 billion roubles compared with 475.7 billion roubles a year ago. Gazprom Neft’s first half crude oil output declined 0.6 percent year-on-year because of a global oil deal between OPEC and other oil producers to curb output, the company said. Russia in July said it planned to increase production again after OPEC and non-OPEC countries agreed to ease production curbs. Gazprom Neft said second-quarter crude oil output rose 3.6 percent quarter on quarter due to higher output in Iraq, its increased share in the Arcticgas venture and the longer duration of the second quarter.
