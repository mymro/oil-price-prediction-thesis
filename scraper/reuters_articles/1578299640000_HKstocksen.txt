His threat against Iraq comes after its parliament voted in favour of expelling U.S. troops. ** For the short-term, equities on the mainland and Hong Kong could be under pressure from the rising Middle East tensions, Zhang Chi, an analyst with Western Securities, said in report. ** The correction pressure would be higher in Hong Kong than in the A-share market, given the former’ s stronger linkage with the U.S. stock market, Zhang added. ** Sectors dropped across the board, except energy shares that gained as the Middle East turmoil also stoked worries about global crude supply and lifted oil prices to nearly four-month peaks. The Hang Seng energy sub-index ended 2.1% firmer. ** Around the region, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index was weaker by 0.82%, while Japan’s Nikkei index closed 1.91% lower. ** The yuan was quoted at 6.9746 per U.S. dollar at 0817 GMT, 0.14% weaker than the previous close of 6.965. ** At close, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 26.93% over Hong Kong-listed H-shares.
