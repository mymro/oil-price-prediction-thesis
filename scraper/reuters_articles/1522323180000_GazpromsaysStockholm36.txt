MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM) expects its profit to take a hit from a ruling by Stockholm’s arbitration court on gas deliveries to Ukraine, Chief Financial Officer Andrei Kruglov said on Thursday. It did not say which financial period would be affected. Gazprom decided not to restart supplies of natural gas to Ukraine after the international arbitration court earlier this year ordered the Russian company to pay $2.56 billion to Ukraine’s Naftogaz after weighing mutual claims and counter-claims related to gas supplies and transit.
