March futures on the S&P TSX index were up 0.23 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET. Canada’s main stock index rose on Wednesday after investor sentiment rebounded following a bullish U.S. inflation report and energy stocks rallied on strong oil prices.

(Morning News Call newsletter here ; The Day Ahead newsletter here) Canadian train and plane maker Bombardier on Thursday beat quarterly profit estimates, driven by an improvement in both sales and margins in its rail division. Canadian oil and gas producer Encana Corp posted better-than-expected adjusted profit for the fourth quarter, helped by an increase in production and higher selling prices for oil. Oil producer Cenovus Energy Inc’s fourth-quarter profit soared, as production nearly doubled and the Canadian company reined in expenses.
