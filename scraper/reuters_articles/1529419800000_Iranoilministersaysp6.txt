LONDON (Reuters) - Iran’s oil minister said on Tuesday that problems in the oil market were political and not the result of a supply and demand imbalance. “The current problem in the oil market is the result of political tension caused by the American president, not supply and demand imbalance,” Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying by SHANA before his departure to the OPEC summit.
