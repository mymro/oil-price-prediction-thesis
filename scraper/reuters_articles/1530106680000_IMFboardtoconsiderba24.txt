JOHANNESBURG, June 27 (Reuters) - The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will examine Congo Republicâ€™s request for a bailout on July 6, according to an IMF calendar seen by Reuters on Wednesday. Like other central African oil producers, Congo, which became a member of OPEC last week, has been hit hard by low crude prices and is struggling under the weight of over $9 billion in debt, around 110 percent of gross domestic product.
