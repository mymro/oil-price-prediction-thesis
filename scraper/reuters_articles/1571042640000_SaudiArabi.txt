RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabiaâ€™s Energy Minister said on Monday it was important to concentrate on the stability of the oil market rather than the price of oil and that a fair price was a stable price.  The minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said oil exporters taking part in the global output deal between OPEC and its allies were showing serious commitment to the cuts.
