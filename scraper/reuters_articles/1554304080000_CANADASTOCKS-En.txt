April 3 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index rose on Wednesday, led by energy shares which advanced as Brent oil price pushed towards a near five-month high. * Sentiment was also lifted by optimism over trade talks between the United States and China and upbeat Chinese data, which calmed fears of a global economic slowdown. * This helped the Canadian dollar edge higher against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday. * The main index is now just 1.6 percent away from its record closing high hit in July. * At 9:47 a.m. ET (13:47 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was up 46.5 points, or 0.29 percent, at 16,310.37. * Energy sector climbed 0.6 percent, the most among the six major sectors trading higher, as OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions lifted crude prices. * On the TSX, 136 issues were higher, while 95 issues declined for a 1.43-to-1 ratio favouring gainers, with 17.83 million shares traded. * The largest percentage gainers on the TSX were Lundin Mining Corp and Home Capital Group. Their shares were up 3.1 percent. * Tricon Capital Group fell 5.8 percent, the most on the TSX, after a deal to buy U.S. multifamily portfolio. * The second biggest decliner was Torex Gold Resources Inc , down 5.1 percent, after reporting first-quarter production results. * The most heavily traded shares by volume were Aurora Cannabis Inc, Nemaska Lithium Inc and Encana Corp. * The TSX posted 12 new 52-week highs and no new lows. * Across all Canadian issues there were 32 new 52-week highs and seven new lows, with total volume of 30.89 million shares.
