Feb 11 (Reuters) - All major Gulf stock markets slipped on Monday amid falling oil prices, with Qatar dropping sharply as its blue-chip banks slid.

Saudi Arabia’s stock market edged down 0.1 percent with Al Rajhi Bank declining 0.4 percent and Saudi British Bank shedding 0.4 percent. In first week of February, foreigners bought 920.7 million riyals ($245.51 million) of Saudi stocks on a net basis, according to stock exchange data.

Qatar’s index fell 0.8 percent with the Middle East and North Africa’s largest lender Qatar National bank dropping 2.9 percent. The bank said that its shareholders approved a 10 for one stock split. Industries Qatar and Vodafone Qatar fell 0.6 percent and 1.1 percent respectively, ahead of their board meetings to discuss full-year earnings. The index slid 0.7 percent with its top-lender Emirates NBD decreasing 1.5 percent. Dubai Investments lost 3.4 percent. The stock has been sliding for the last three sessions after saying it bought an additional 66 percent stake in Globalpharma, bringing its stake to 100 percent.
