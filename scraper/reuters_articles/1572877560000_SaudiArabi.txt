DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has raised its December official selling price (OSP) for its Arab Light grade for Asian customers by $0.40 a barrel versus November to a premium of $3.40 per barrel to the Oman/Dubai average, state oil company Aramco said on Monday. The worldâ€™s top oil exporter was expected to raise prices of light crude grades it sells to Asia in December amid higher Middle East benchmarks, while a slump in fuel oil margins could lead to a deep price cut for its heavy grade, a Reuters survey showed. Saudi Arabia raised its December Arab Light OSP for Northwest Europe, setting it at a discount of $0.05 a barrel to ICE Brent, up $2.80 a barrel from November. The Arab Light OSP to the United States was set at a premium of $3.35 a barrel to the Argus Sour Crude Index (ASCI) for December, up 40 cents from the previous month.
