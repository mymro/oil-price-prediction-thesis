(Reuters) - The following are changes in oil output limits by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, dating from efforts in the late 1990s to prop up prices. The last change occurred in November 2016, when OPEC and 10 non-OPEC countries agreed to cut output by a combined 1.8 million barrels per day from Jan. 1, 2017. OPEC’s share of the cut is about 1.2 million bpd and two members, Nigeria and Libya, were exempted. OPEC and its allies meet on June 22-23 in Vienna and will discuss whether to ease the supply cut. Volumes are in millions of barrels per day.

The ceiling of 28.8 million bpd was adjusted to reflect Indonesia’s suspension of membership and to include Angola and Ecuador. *** Target of 30 million bpd applied to all the then 12 members including Iraq, which was previously exempt. **** Targets announced for 11 OPEC members, all except Libya and Nigeria, amounting to a cut of about 1.2 million bpd. ^^ Equatorial Guinea, which was already participating in the OPEC and non-OPEC supply cut deal, joined OPEC.
