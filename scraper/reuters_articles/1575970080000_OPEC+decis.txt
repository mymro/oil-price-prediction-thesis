MOSCOW (Reuters) - Gazprom Neft CEO Alexander Dyukov said on Tuesday a decision by OPEC and its allies to reduce output last week would help support oil prices at $55-65 per barrel in the first quarter, the Interfax news agency reported. It was right of OPEC and its allies to exclude Russian gas condensate when calculating Russiaâ€™s oil output, he said.
