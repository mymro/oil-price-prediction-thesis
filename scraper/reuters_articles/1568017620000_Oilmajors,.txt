The main index edged 0.2% higher by 0711 GMT, while a 10% jump in Intu Properties after a report of takeover interest aided a 0.3% rise in the mid-cap index. Gains on both the bourses come ahead of a slew of British economic data, including gross domestic product data, scheduled later this morning. Oil majors BP and Shell climbed about 1.3%, as crude prices rose. Lender Lloyds weighed on the blue-chip index, with a 1.5% fall after saying it was suspending its remaining 2019 buyback program, while Associated British Foods gave up 2% on poor outlook for its Primark fashion chain.
