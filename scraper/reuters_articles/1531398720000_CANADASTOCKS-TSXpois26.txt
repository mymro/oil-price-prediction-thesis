July 12 (Reuters) - Futures pointed to a higher opening for Canada’s main stock index on Thursday, as oil prices rise after the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned of output capacity limits. Crude prices recovered from sharp losses in the previous session when Libya said it would resume oil exports and received a boost from the IEA, which said the world’s oil supply cushion “might be stretched to the limit” due to production losses.
