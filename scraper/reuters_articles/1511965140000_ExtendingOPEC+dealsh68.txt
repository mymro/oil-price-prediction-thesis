MOSCOW (Reuters) - Extending a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC nations on oil output cuts would hopefully curb oil price volatility in the near-term, the RIA news agency cited Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich as saying on Wednesday. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak met his Saudi counterpart Khalid al-Falih earlier on Wednesday, one day before a full OPEC meeting in Vienna to discuss oil prices, the Russian energy ministry said.
