* Oil prices rise, supported by U.S. jobs data, Iran sanctions * Yields hit multi-year highs after solid jobs report * Wall St slides as bond yields climb on jobs data (Updates throughout with afternoon trading) By Laila Kearney NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Stock markets dipped around the world on Friday after U.S. jobs numbers signaled a continued tightening of the labor market and increased inflation pressures, while Treasury yields rose to multi-year highs. The increase in non-farm payrolls slowed in September, likely from Hurricane Florence’s impact on restaurant and retail payrolls, but the U.S. Labor Department report also showed a rise in wages that could keep the Federal Reserve on track for more interest rate hikes. “Good news for economy is bad news for equity investors right now,” said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group’s in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 190.64 points, or 0.72 percent, to 26,436.84, the S&P 500 lost 16.08 points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,885.53 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 86.52 points, or 1.1 percent, to 7,792.99. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.86 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.70 percent. A steep sell-off in Treasury bonds that started midweek and pushed 10-year yields to seven-year highs has weighed on stocks and rippled through bond markets globally. “This week has been a bit of a bloodbath on the fixed income side of things,” said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto. “I think the market moves in the bonds this week side-swiped a lot of individuals.” The 30-year Treasury bond reached a four-year high of 3.424 percent, up 7 basis points from late Thursday. The benchmark 10-year yield rose to 3.248 percent, up 5.3 basis points from late Thursday. The U.S. bond market will be closed on Monday for the Columbus Day holiday, but stock markets will open. In the currency market, the U.S. dollar weakened in choppy trading. The dollar index fell 0.09 percent. The euro was up 0.06 percent to $1.152. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.11 percent versus the greenback at 113.81 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3104, up 0.66 percent on the day. Fears about Italy’s finances pushed Milan stocks down 1.3 percent, while London’s FTSE, Frankfurt’s DAX and the CAC in Paris were off 0.95 to 1.4 percent. In oil, Crude futures settled up for the week as U.S. unemployment data eased concerns about demand in the world’s top oil consumer and ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports. For the day, U.S. crude futures settled at $74.34 per barrel, up 0.001 percent, and Brent settled at $84.16, down 0.50 percent. At around four-year highs, oil prices have triggered concerns about demand as U.S. President Donald Trump has blamed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for rising gasoline prices for American consumers. Prices have eased slightly after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would raise output to at least partly make up for expected disruptions from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, due to the sanctions that take effect on Nov. 4. The combination of rising oil prices, borrowing costs and a climbing dollar have also been rocking emerging markets, which tend to be vulnerable to all three. Emerging market stocks lost 1.01 percent, putting them on track to close at a 17-month low.
