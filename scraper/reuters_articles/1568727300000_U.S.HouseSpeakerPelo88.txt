WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has requested a briefing for all House members on the Saudi Aramco attacks and Iran, a spokesman said on Tuesday. House leaders asked for the intelligence briefings after drone attacks Saturday on two oil facilities sent oil prices soaring and raised fears of a new Middle East conflict.
