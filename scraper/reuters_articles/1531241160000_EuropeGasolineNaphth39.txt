LONDON, July 10 (Reuters) - Benchmark northwest European gasoline refining margins rose on Tuesday, supported by signs of stronger Asian demand, while Atlantic basin activity remained weak. * Over 600,000 tonnes of gasoline have been booked to load in Europe with options to deliver on transatlantic routes in the past week, shipping data showed. * But overall buying from the key U.S. East Coast market remained signifanctly lower for this time of year than in recent years, according to traders. * A surge in U.S. refining output in recent months has led to a sharp rise in inventories in the country, dampening demand for imports, traders said. * Asia’s naphtha crack edged up 1.8 percent to stay at a five-week high of $90.15 a tonne on Tuesday, supported by demand. * Italy’s Milazzo oil refinery shut a crude distillation unit for maintenance that will last until Friday, a spokesman said. * Three barges of Eurobob gasoline traded in the afternoon window at $733-$734 a tonne fob ARA. Total sold to Shell and Vitol. * Elsewhere, 19,000 tonnes of Eurobob gasoline traded in a range of $728.50-$729 a tonne fob Amsterdam-Rotterdam, compared with $716-$722 a tonne the previous session.
