NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was lower on Friday along with Wall Street stocks as investors pulled back from technology stocks and were skeptical President Donald Trump’s Republican party would succeed in its efforts at overhauling U.S. tax law. U.S. Treasury yields edged lower, in line with declines in U.S. stock indexes and German 10-year bond yields, as risk appetite faded. The yield curve continued to flatten after strong U.S. housing starts data for October and investors bet on further rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. “The front end of the curve is building in the greater and greater probability of Fed rate hikes,” said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies in New York. The U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of its version of a tax overhaul bill that would cut corporate taxes on Thursday. But then investors’ focus turned to the Senate’s battle over its rival bill and worries about whether the House and Senate will ever agree on a compromise. “Traders are not jumping the gun here. They’re looking to see what happens as the political sausage-making process runs its course,” said Karl Schamotta, director of global product and market strategy at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. He added that while potential benefits to the dollar may be priced in, tax reform disappointment would hurt it. The dollar was also dented by a report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team last month subpoenaed Trump’s election campaign for documents containing specified Russian keywords from more than a dozen officials. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.28 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.2 percent to $1.1793. The S&P 500 fell as investors eyed the prospects for tax cuts and positioned themselves for the close of earnings season and what is typically a quieter week as many traders take a break around Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday. “Everybody is looking at that tax plan and wondering exactly what are the devils in the details,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 100.12 points, or 0.43 percent, to 23,358.24, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 6.79 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,578.85 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 10.50 points, or 0.15 percent, to 6,782.79. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.29 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS was fractionally higher.
