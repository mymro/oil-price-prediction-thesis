Sept 16 (Reuters) - Futures for Canada’s main stock index were lower on Monday after a weekend attack on crude facilities in Saudi Arabia disrupted global oil supplies and fuelled worries over the impact of an oil shock on economic growth. An attack on Saudi Arabia that shut 5% of global crude output caused the biggest surge in oil prices since 1991. U.S. officials blamed Iran for the strike and President Donald Trump said Washington was “locked and loaded” to retaliate. September futures on the S&P/TSX index were down 0.08% at 7:00 a.m. ET.
