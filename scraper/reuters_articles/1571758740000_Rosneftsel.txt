MOSCOW, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Rosneft Trading SA, a subsidiary of Russian oil producer Rosneft, has sold a 100,000 tonne cargo of contaminated oil to energy trader Vitol with a discount of more than $25 per barrel to dated Brent, traders said on Tuesday. The hefty discount is far more than Russian pipeline monopoly Transneftâ€™s offer of $15 per barrel to compensate for the excessive organic chloride content in oil.
