(Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services firm Halliburton Co is restricting non-critical business travel to the Asia-Pacific region, a spokeswoman for the company said on Tuesday, joining others taking travel precautions due to the coronavirus outbreak. More than 400 people have died from the virus which originated in China, according to authorities in that country, and the number of infections reported there has climbed to over 20,000. There have been nearly 200 cases across two dozen other countries and Chinaâ€™s special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau. The United States has reported 11 cases. The outbreak has roiled financial and commodity markets amid concerns that it will affect the global economy. OPEC and allies including Russia are considering cutting oil out put by an additional 500,000 barrels per day due to the impact on oil demand, Reuters reported this week. Halliburton said it was monitoring the situation. Earlier, Chevron Corp asked its staff to postpone non-business critical travel to China and airlines have been canceling flights out of the county due to travel restrictions.
