NEW YORK (Reuters) - Declines in chipmaker shares weighed on stocks across the globe on Monday, while U.S. energy shares fell as crude dropped and the dollar slipped against the yen. U.S. chipmaker stocks .SOX fell 1.3 percent after closing at a record high on Friday. A Morgan Stanley note on global technology downgraded Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor and argued it is time for a pause for chipmakers, which have seen stellar performance this year. Tech stocks in Europe .SX8P fell 0.7 percent. “The (stock) market is looking at the rest of the world and seeing it’s a little bit soft, while the early read on holiday sales has been pretty good,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Consumer Discretionary sector .SPLRCD was among the top boosts to the S&P, lead by Amazon (AMZN.O), as sales data indicated an upbeat consumer during the first weekend of the U.S. holiday shopping season. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 22.79 points, or 0.1 percent, to 23,580.78, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1 point, or 0.04 percent, to 2,601.42 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 10.64 points, or 0.15 percent, to 6,878.52.

The slide tracked a 1.9 percent decline in U.S. crude CLc1 to $57.83 per barrel while Brent LCOcv1 was last at $63.73, down 0.2 percent on the day. Prospects of higher U.S. supply from a planned restart of the Keystone crude pipeline and uncertainty about Russia’s resolve to join in extending output cuts ahead of this week’s OPEC meeting weighed on oil prices. “It’s the OPEC parlor game that we’re all playing,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York, “The Russians being quiet about their intentions about the OPEC deal is a little unsettling.” The dollar index .DXY rose 0.15 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.27 percent to $1.1898. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.41 percent versus the greenback at 111.09 per dollar, the strongest level for the Japanese currency since mid September.
