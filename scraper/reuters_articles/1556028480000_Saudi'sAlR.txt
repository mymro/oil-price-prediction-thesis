DUBAI, April 23 (Reuters) - Al Rajhi Bank, Saudi Arabia’s second-largest lender by assets, reported a 21 percent rise in its first-quarter net profit on Tuesday. The bank made 2.89 billion riyals in the three months to March 31, up from 2.38 billion riyals in the same period a year earlier, it said in a bourse statement. Saudi banks’ performance in 2019 should be boosted by a surge in liquidity and an anticipated recovery in lending amid higher oil prices. (Reporting by Nafisa Eltahir, editing by Hadeel Al Sayegh)
