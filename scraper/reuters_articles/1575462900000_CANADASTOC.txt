Dec 4 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index futures rose on Wednesday, as oil prices gained in the run-up to meetings where OPEC and its allies are expected to extend output cuts, while investors awaited the central bank’s decision on interest rates. The Bank of Canada, which is scheduled to announce its interest rate decision at 10:00 a.m. ET, is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 1.75%, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
