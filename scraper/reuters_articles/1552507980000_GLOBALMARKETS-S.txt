(Adds gold, oil settlement prices, Boeing shares decline) * U.S. data points to economic growth with low inflation * Dollar dips on U.S. data; Brexit keeps sterling on hold * World shares off 4-1/2-month highs on slowdown fears * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - World equity markets advanced broadly on Wednesday after U.S. data again showed risk-friendly low inflation, which weakened the dollar, but shares of Boeing retreated after the United States said it would ground the company’s 737 MAX aircraft. Shares in Europe rose on investor optimism that British lawmakers will rule out a “no-deal” Brexit. U.S. producer prices barely edged higher in February, in the smallest annual increase since June 2017, the latest sign of benign inflation that supports the Federal Reserve’s patient approach to future interest rate hikes. Other data showed new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods rose by the most in six months in January and shipments also rose, but business spending on equipment remained soft, leaving forecasts for weak first-quarter economic growth intact. U.S. stocks advanced broadly. Boeing gained in early trade for the first time since Sunday’s crash of a 737 MAX 8 jet in Ethiopia, but the shares later retreated after first Canada and then the United States said they were grounding 737 MAX jets, following steps already taken by Europe and other nations. Shares fell 3.0 percent. Economic data still suggests an “OK” economy but analysts’ estimates of corporate profits are slowing, which is worrisome, said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group in New York. “Earnings estimate revisions continue to come downward, but that does not seem for the moment to be fazing equity investors,” he said. “It’s the old mantra: don’t fight the Fed.” A Fed on hold for hiking rates suggests concern about economic growth, which can be seen in a narrowing gap in 10-year and two-year U.S. Treasury yields, Geraghty said. An inverted yield curve historically has been an indicator of recession. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.57 percent while the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares closed up 0.69 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.38 points, or 0.27 percent, to 25,623.04. The S&P 500 gained 21.58 points, or 0.77 percent, to 2,813.1, and the Nasdaq Composite added 64.68 points, or 0.85 percent, to 7,655.71. The British pound rose ahead of another vote in Parliament on a proposal that would rule out a “no deal” exit from the European Union. Sterling rose 1.01 percent to $1.3205 while the dollar softened against the yen and euro. The dollar index fell 0.27 percent, with the euro up 0.23 percent to $1.1312. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.28 percent versus the greenback at 111.08 per dollar. U.S. Treasury yields rose after falling the previous session as risk appetite improved and equity markets steadied. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 2/32 in price to push yields up to 2.6141 percent. “After yesterday’s CPI data, yields fell. So some of these are just rebound after that,” said Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist at Evercore ISI in New York. Oil futures rallied more than 1 percent as an unexpected drop in U.S. crude inventory and a forecast of slower-than-expected supply growth from the world’s top crude producer boosted prices. U.S. crude stocks fell last week as refineries hiked output, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. U.S. crude rose $1.39 to settle at $58.26 per barrel and Brent settled up 88 cents at $67.55. Gold hit nearly a two-week high as tepid U.S. economic data reinforced views the Fed would be patient on monetary policy. U.S. gold futures settled 0.9 percent higher at $1,309.3 per ounce.
