BAKU (Reuters) - Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said on Sunday there has been a build-up in oil inventories despite a decline in output from Iran and Venezuela. Falih also told a press briefing in Baku that compliance for an OPEC+ deal in March would be “above 100 percent”, adding that Saudi oil output would not continue indefinitely to compensate for other producers.
