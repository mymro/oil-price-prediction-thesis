May 15 (Reuters) - Futures for Canada’s main stock index were little changed on Wednesday ahead of April inflation data. June futures on the S&P/TSX index were down 0.02% at 7:00 a.m. ET. The monthly CPI inflation data is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Oil prices fell after data showed a surprise rise in U.S. crude inventories and the U.S.-China trade dispute threatened oil demand, although Middle East tensions capped losses. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX rose 91.12 points, or 0.56%, to 16,284.53 on Tuesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures were down 0.23% at 7:00 a.m. ET, while S&P 500 e-mini futures were down 0.19% and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures were down 0.14%. Cannabis producers Tilray Inc and Aurora Cannabis Inc on Tuesday reported a surge in quarterly revenue, boosted by increased demand following the legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada. Billionaire Gerry Schwartz’s $2.6 billion bid for WestJet Airlines is a bet his private equity firm’s deep pockets and patience will help the Canadian carrier weather challenges and build a more formidable competitor against market leader Air Canada, industry analysts and executives said on Tuesday.
