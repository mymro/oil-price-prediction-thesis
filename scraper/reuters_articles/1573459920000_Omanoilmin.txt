ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Oman’s oil minister said on Monday that OPEC and non-OPEC producers are likely to extend an agreement to cut oil production next year, but deeper cuts were unlikely.  Mohammed bin Hamad al-Rumhy said Oman was satisfied with the current oil prices which are “good” for the economy. Oil demand is improving as trade tensions softened, he said.
