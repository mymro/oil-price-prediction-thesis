MOSCOW, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday he considered the new Saudi energy minister a friend for more than two decades despite tensions between the two countries. Iran and Saudi Arabia have repeatedly clashed at OPEC meetings over output policies. “Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has been a friend for over 22 years,” Zanganeh told an energy conference in Moscow. A senior member of Saudi royal family, Prince Abdulaziz became minister of energy for Saudi Arabia in September. (Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov, editing by Louise Heavens)
