Sept 24 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index rose on Monday as energy shares were boosted by a surge in crude prices after Saudi Arabia and Russia ruled out any immediate increase to oil production. * The energy sector was 2 percent higher as U.S. crude rose 2 percent and Brent crude added 2.4 percent. * Barrick Gold, up 6.7 percent, was the top boost to materials stocks after the company agreed to buy Randgold Resources in an $18.3 billion share deal to create the world’s largest gold company by value. * The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 1.2 percent. * Gold prices were steady partly due to a dip in the dollar, but activity was muted as investors awaited a U.S. central bank meeting this week that is expected to result in an interest rate increase. * At 9:50 a.m. ET (1350 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was up 29.72 points, or 0.18 percent, at 16,253.85. * Still, seven of the index’s 11 major sectors were lower.
