(Recasts, updates deal size) DUBAI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) , the largest lender in the United Arab Emirates, has raised $850 million in Islamic bonds, a document issued by one of the banks leading the deal showed on Tuesday. The five-year sukuk offer buyers 130 basis points over mid-swaps, 20 basis points below the indicative price FAB proposed when it started marketing the notes. FAB, rated Aa3 by Moody’s and AA-(minus) by S&P and Fitch, is the first issuer in the Gulf to tap the international sukuk market this year. S&P’s global head of Islamic finance, Mohamed Damak, said that sukuk issuance out of the Gulf is expected to increase this year if Brent oil prices fall below S&P’s forecast of $55 a barrel over a sustained period. Brent crude oil futures were at $60.15 a barrel at 1621 GMT on Tuesday. FAB’s debt sale was expected to be set at $750 million but was later increased by $100 million as orders climbed above $2.8 billion during the day. Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates NBD Capital , First Abu Dhabi Bank, KFH Capital, NCB Capital Company, Sharjah Islamic Bank and Standard Chartered Bank have been mandated to arrange the issuance.
