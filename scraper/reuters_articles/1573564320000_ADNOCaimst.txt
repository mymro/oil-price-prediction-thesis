ABU DHABI, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company aims to make its Murban futures contract a replacement for Brent, as the North Sea benchmark volumes are declining, the company’s head of trading, Philippe Khoury, told a conference on Tuesday in Abu Dhabi. “We still have to demonstrate that over time the community can trust the crude as a benchmark,” he said, adding that Murban would be “giving the industry a replacement for Brent.” (Reporting by Rania El Gamal; writing by Maher Chmaytelli)
