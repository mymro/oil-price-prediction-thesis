June 14 (Reuters) - Futures pointed to a lower opening for Canada’s main stock index on Friday on fears that trade disputes may hurt global oil demand, a day after tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman lifted oil prices sharply. The International Energy Agency cut its demand growth forecast for 2019 by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1.2 million bpd. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had on Thursday cut its 2019 forecast for growth in global oil demand even lower than the IEA, to 1.14 million bpd.
