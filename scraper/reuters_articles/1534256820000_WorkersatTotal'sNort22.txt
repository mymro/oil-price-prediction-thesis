LONDON (Reuters) - Workers at three of French oil company Total’s North Sea oil platforms will meet the company on Thursday for further negotiations over working conditions and are considering strike action on six different dates in August, September and October, union Unite said in a statement on Tuesday. The three platforms in question are Alwyn, Elgin and Dunbar. “Ultimately, the talks to date have not been productive nor produced significant movement by the company to address the concerns of our members,” the union said. “Unite has agreed after consultation with its members to hold further discussions with Total on Thursday (16 August) with a view to try and reach a resolution to the dispute.” Industrial action is scheduled to take place on Aug. 20, which would last 24 hours, as well as on Sept. 3 and 17, and Oct. 1, 5 and 29, the union said. The workers are planning to strike over proposed changes to their working rotas and pay. The three fields’ oil production contributes about 45,000 to 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the Forties and Brent Blend crude streams. The fields also contribute about 10 percent of Britain’s total natural gas output.
