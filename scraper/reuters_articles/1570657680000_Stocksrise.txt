NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks gained on Wednesday on a report that China could yet agree to a partial trade deal with the United States despite recent tensions, while the prospect of a last-minute Brexit agreement between the European Union and Britain seemed as remote as ever. Sterling was little changed against the dollar after losing nearly 1% over the past two sessions. China is still open to agreeing to a partial trade deal, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, despite the recent U.S. blacklisting of Chinese technology firms and reports on visa restrictions from both sides. “You don’t want to ignore headlines, but at the same time each headline seems to say the same thing - that both sides want to see something happen and both sides are encouraged that something may happen,” said Michael Lorizio, senior fixed income trader at Manulife Investment Management in Boston. Markets have churned this month on mounting evidence that the U.S.-China trade war is damaging the global economy. Stocks have been particularly sensitive to headlines regarding trade. “A partial deal with China would at least pave the way for a larger deal down the road,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “Every day we get a different tweet and the market takes a different direction. Today is an up day on a favorable tweet.” Graphic: Global assets in 2019 - tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl Graphic: Global currencies vs. dollar - tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh Graphic: Emerging markets in 2019 - tmsnrt.rs/2ihRugV Stocks pared gains sharply toward the session close after Reuters reported Beijing has lowered expectations for significant progress from this week’s trade talks.

Talks between the European Union and Britain over a deal for London’s departure from the EU on Oct. 31 appeared to be going nowhere.
