MOSCOW (Reuters) - Gazprom will continue to supply gas to Poland’s dominant gas firm, state-run PGNiG, until the end of their existing contract, the Russian gas giant’s exporting arm said on Friday. In a statement, Gazprom Export confirmed PGNiG had earlier notified it of its intention not to extend their long-term deal on gas supplies when it expires after 2022.
