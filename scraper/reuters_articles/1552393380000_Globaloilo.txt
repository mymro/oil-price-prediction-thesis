MOSCOW (Reuters) - Obligations under the global oil output deal between OPEC and several other oil exporters have not been completely fulfilled by all parties, including Russia, the head of Russiaâ€™s Gazprom Neft said on Tuesday.   It is too early to say whether the deal will be extended, or whether quotas will be revised, said Alexander Dyukov, head of Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of Russian gas giant Gazprom.
