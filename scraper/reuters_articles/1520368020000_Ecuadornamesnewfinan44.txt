QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador President Lenin Moreno on Tuesday named a new finance minister following the unexpected resignation of his top finance official, as his government prepared to announce a plan to revive its sluggish economy. Maria Elsa Viteri, 53, who was finance minister under ex-president Rafael Correa, will replace the outgoing Carlos de la Torre, who stepped down without offering reasons for his departure. “President Lenin Moreno accepted the resignation of Carlos de la Torre as Minister of Economy and Finance ... Maria Elsa Viteri has been appointed as his replacement,” the presidency said in a statement. Viteri was Finance Minister from September 2008 to April 2010 under Correa, who was Moreno’s ally and mentor until the latter was elected last year and the two fell out. Viteri, who had retired from politics, is considered close to Correa. The economy of one of the smallest OPEC member has suffered under low oil prices and a heavy debt burden as well as from damage cause by a major earthquake in 2016.
