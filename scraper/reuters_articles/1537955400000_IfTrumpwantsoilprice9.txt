GENEVA, Sept 26 (Reuters) - If U.S. President Donald Trump wants the price of oil to stop going up, he should stop interfering in the Middle East, Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday, according to the Iranian Students’ News Agency (ISNA). “Mr. Trump is trying to seriously reduce exports of Iran’s oil and also ensure the price of oil does not go up, but these two cannot happen together,” Zanganeh said, according to ISNA. “If he wants the price of oil not to go up and the market not to get destabilized, he should stop unwarranted and disruptive interference in the Middle East and not be an obstacle to the production and export of Iran’s oil.” (Reporting By Babak Dehghanpisheh; Editing by Hugh Lawson)
