October 22 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index futures were higher on Tuesday after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals were re-elected in a closely fought election. Trudeau hung onto power after an election on Monday that saw his government reduced to a minority, but aides predicted he would be able to govern for two years without many problems. Canadian PM’s Liberals only won 156 seats, a decrease of 21, preliminary results showed. December futures on the S&P/TSX index were up 0.21% at 7:00 a.m. ET. Retail sales data is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index rose 0.25% to 16,418.45 on Monday. Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures were up 0.1% at 7:00 a.m. ET, S&P 500 e-mini futures 0.03% and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures 0.13%. Canada’s biggest bank, RBC, forecast more pressure for domestic oil storage and pipeline businesses on Tuesday after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals retained power but were stripped to a minority government that will need the support of a smaller left-leaning party to govern. Bombardier on Monday unveiled its revamped Liberty Learjet 75 corporate plane, betting that extra legroom and a lower price tag would help the Canadian company beat back competition from Embraer SA’s market leading model.
