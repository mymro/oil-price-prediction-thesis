SINGAPORE, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Oil prices could rise to $90 per barrel by Christmas and to $100 per barrel by the New Year, Trafiguraâ€™s Co-Head of Oil Trading Ben Luckock told a conference on Monday. This would be an increase from the current nearly $80 a barrel for Brent crude oil prices due to robust global oil demand, he added.
