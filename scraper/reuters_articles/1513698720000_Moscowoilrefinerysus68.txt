MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russiaâ€™s Moscow oil refinery, owned by Gazprom Neft, has suspended exports of diesel due to a damaged pipeline, traders said on Tuesday. Gazprom Neft said the plant was working according to schedule. A trader said he expected exports to resume in next few days. Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft (TRNF_p.MM) earlier on Monday said it had stopped pumping oil products such as diesel through one of its pipelines after finding signs of an oil spill.
