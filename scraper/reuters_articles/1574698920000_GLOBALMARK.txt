(Adds U.S. market open, byline; changes dateline; previous LONDON) * S&P 500, Nasdaq hit record highs * Gold slides to 2-week low * Euro pinned to near 10-day lows on bleak outlook By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Gold fell for a fourth straight session and global equity markets rallied on Monday, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hitting new highs on revived hopes the United States and China could soon sign an interim deal to end their prolonged trade war. A spate of merger & acquisition activity buoyed investor sentiment, while trade-sensitive miners in Europe and semiconductors on Wall Street rose on reports suggesting the world’s two largest economies were close to an initial trade deal. France’s LVMH agreed to buy luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co for $16.2 billion and Charles Schwab Corp agreed to buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp AMTD.O in an all-stock deal valued at $26 billion. U.S. national security adviser Robert O’Brien said on Saturday that a trade pact was still possible by year’s end, while Chinese state-backed tabloid Global Times said Beijing and Washington were “very close” to a “phase one” trade deal. Adding to the positive mood was the weekend announcement that China would seek to improve protections for intellectual property rights, a sticking point in the talks. “China being prepared to look at intellectual property is obviously the catalyst for a nice move higher, or a return to the highs earlier this month,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London.
