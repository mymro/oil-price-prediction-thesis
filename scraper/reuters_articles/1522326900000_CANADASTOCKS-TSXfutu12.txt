March 29 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index futures were little changed on Thursday as investors awaited a report on gross domestic product for January to gauge the health of the economy. June futures on the S&P TSX index were down 0.04 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET. GDP data for January and producer prices data for February are due at 8:30 a.m. ET. The GDP data is expected to show a rise of 0.1 percent. Canada’s main stock index closed at a six-week low on Wednesday as a retreat in gold and oil prices weighed on mining and energy companies, but a rebound in Hudson Bay shares capped the losses. Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures were up 0.3 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET, while S&P 500 e-mini futures were 0.34 percent higher and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures rose 0.65 percent.
