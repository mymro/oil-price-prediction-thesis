ST PETERSBURG, June 14 (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC producers should raise oil production starting from the second half of the year in order to keep the market balance and acceptable oil prices, Alexander Dyukov, the head of Russia’s Gazprom Neft, said on Friday. He told reporters that the oil price range of $55-$65 per barrel is “acceptable” for the Russian producers, while the company is ready to quickly restore its oil output, curbed by a global agreement.
