The following company announcements, scheduled economic indicators, debt and currency market moves and political events may affect South African markets on Friday. South Africa’s rand regained as much as 2 percent on Thursday after an easing in the sell-off on emerging markets stemming from fears of a trade war between the United States and China. Most Asian share markets rose on Friday, heartened by gains on Wall Street fueled by expectations of strong U.S. earnings, but China’s markets wobbled as investors braced for the impact of broadening, tit-for-tat Chinese-U.S tariffs. U.S. stock futures rose to a five-month high on Friday, extending their recent rally on expectations of solid earnings growth among U.S. firms despite threats from trade wars. Gold prices were muted on Friday, stuck in a tight trading range as the dollar extended gains from the previous session when strong U.S. inflation data and trade war concerns boosted demand for the greenback. Oil prices edged lower on Friday and were set for a second weekly fall, as the market shrugged off a warning that spare capacity may be stretched as OPEC and Russia increase production.
