NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States will be committing $36 million in aid to Venezuela, as part of a United Nations program to provide relief to the country, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) administrator Mark Green said on Wednesday. The U.N. has said it needs $223 million for its programs to serve 2.6 million vulnerable Venezuelans this year, but has raised only a fraction of that amount. The once-prosperous OPEC member is suffering a hyperinflationary economic collapse marked by chronic shortages of food and medicine.
