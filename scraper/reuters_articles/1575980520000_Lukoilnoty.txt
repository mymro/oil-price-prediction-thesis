MOSCOW (Reuters) - Lukoil has not been briefed on how Russiaâ€™s lowered oil output target will impact individual companies, Vice President Ilya Mandrik told reporters on Tuesday. The OPEC+ group of oil producing countries announced plans last week to reduce their output. Mandrik also told reporters that his company will be able to restore its output quickly once the current OPEC+ output deal expires.
