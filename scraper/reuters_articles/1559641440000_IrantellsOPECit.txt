LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - Iran has told OPEC that it opposes delaying the oil producer groupâ€™s next meeting, setting the scene for another fight with fellow members as U.S. sanctions put Tehran under unprecedented economic pressure with its oil exports down to just a trickle. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh, in a letter seen by Reuters, said he disagreed with an OPEC proposal to reschedule the meeting to early July. The talks are currently set to take place on June 25-26. In a separate letter, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said Algeria and Kazakhstan also disagreed with moving the dates.
