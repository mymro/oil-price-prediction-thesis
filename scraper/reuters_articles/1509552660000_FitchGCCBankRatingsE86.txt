(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: GCC Banks: 2017 Compendium here LONDON, November 01 (Fitch) Fitch's Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) bank ratings are marginally down over the past year and nearly one-third are on Negative Outlook, linked to potentially weaker sovereign ability in some GCC countries to provide support to banks if needed. Nevertheless, more than three-quarters of Fitch's GCC bank ratings are still boosted by potential sovereign support and the market overall is predominantly investment grade. We believe sovereign ability to provide support has diminished in Saudi Arabia (largely as a consequence of lower oil prices) and Qatar (after several Arab countries severed diplomatic and logistical ties earlier this year), reducing the average Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of banks in these countries by one notch. We downgraded Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign ratings by one notch earlier this year and revised the sovereign Outlooks on Oman and Bahrain to Negative. The Outlook on Qatar is also Negative. The high proportion of GCC bank IDRs on Negative Outlook is largely linked to the Negative Outlooks on Oman, Bahrain and Qatar. However, sovereign willingness to provide support has remained extremely strong throughout the region and we do not expect this to change - even with the introduction of bank resolution schemes - in the foreseeable future. The Qatari government, for example, has supported banks with public-sector deposits this year, alleviating the impact of outflows sparked by the boycott of Qatar. Most GCC bank IDRs (77%) are driven by potential sovereign support directly or via the bank's parent, with just 19% driven by the bank's standalone creditworthiness as defined by its Viability Rating (VR). The remaining 4% are driven by potential parent support that is not linked to sovereign support. Only about half of GCC bank VRs are investment grade. VRs are typically strongest in Saudi Arabia, where banks benefit from a more favourable operating environment. In Qatar, all VRs are on Rating Watch Negative, reflecting heightened risks to their operating environment, funding, liquidity and earnings while the boycott continues.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).
