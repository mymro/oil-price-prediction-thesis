(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) * FTSE 100 up 0.9%, FTSE 250 up 0.6% * Chinese moves on corporate interest rates lift stocks globally * BP, Shell jump as Yemen attack adds to Middle East tensions * HSBC up 2%, leading other Asia-focussed financials Aug 19 (Reuters) - Sharp rises in oil company shares drove Britain’s FTSE 100 higher on Monday, after an attack on a Saudi oil facility by Yemeni separatists pushed crude prices higher, while Asia-exposed banks gained following moves by China to keep business interest rates low. By 0710 GMT, the FTSE 100 had jumped nearly 1%, its biggest one-day rise in more than 10 days, while the midcap index was 0.6% higher. Shell and BP both rose 1.5%, tracking a surge in crude prices following a drone attack by Yemen’s Houthi group on an oilfield in eastern Saudi Arabia on Saturday, which caused a fire at a gas plant and added to Middle East tensions. Miners and Asia-exposed financial heavyweights, led by HSBC with a near 2% rise, also offered support after China’s central bank announced a set of reforms to help lower borrowing costs for companies and support an economy that has been bruised by the trade war with the United States.
