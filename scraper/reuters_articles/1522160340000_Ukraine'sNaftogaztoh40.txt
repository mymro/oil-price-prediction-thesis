KIEV, March 27 (Reuters) - Ukrainian state-owned energy firm Naftogaz on Tuesday said it would hold further talks with Russia’s Gazprom in April after recent negotiations failed to end a disagreement over an international court’s ruling in Naftogaz’s favour. “Gazprom’s refusal to honour valid arbitration awards by an internationally valued and respected commercial arbitration tribunal seriously questions Gazprom’s trustworthiness as a partner to the European gas industry,” it said.
