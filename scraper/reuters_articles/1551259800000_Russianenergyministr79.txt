MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russiaâ€™s energy ministry plans to meet domestic oil companies on March 1 to discuss a deal between OPEC and other leading global oil producers to reduce production, two sources familiar with the plans told Reuters on Wednesday. A Gulf OPEC source said that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will stick with their agreement to cut oil supply, pushing for more adherence despite a demand by U.S. President Donald Trump that the producer group ease its efforts to boost crude prices.
