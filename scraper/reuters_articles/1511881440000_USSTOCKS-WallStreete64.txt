* Buffalo Wild Wings gains after Roark Capital bid * Emerson higher after pulling Rockwell Automation offer * Oil down for a second day ahead of OPEC decision * Indexes up: Dow 0.25 pct, S&P 0.17 pct, Nasdaq 0.13 pct (Updates to open) By Sruthi Shankar and Rama Venkat Raman Nov 28 (Reuters) - The S&P and the Dow hit records at the open on Tuesday, led by gains in technology stocks, with investors also focusing on Federal Reserve chair nominee Jerome Powell’s confirmation hearing and progress on the U.S. tax bill. The Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing shortly to confirm Powell’s nomination as head of the U.S. central bank. In prepared remarks, Powell defended the Fed’s use of broad crisis-fighting powers, placing himself as an extension of the line followed by current Chair Janet Yellen and her predecessor Ben Bernanke. Analysts see little impact on the stock market. “Some of his comments were already published and he is basically going to follow the present monetary policy,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. “The tax code is really what’s on the minds of the investors right now,” Cardillo said. The U.S. tax plan faces potential opposition from two Republican lawmakers who could prevent the sweeping legislation from reaching the Senate floor. President Donald Trump was due to lobby Republicans at their weekly policy luncheon in the U.S. Capitol, with the Senate poised for a possible vote on the bill as early as Thursday.
