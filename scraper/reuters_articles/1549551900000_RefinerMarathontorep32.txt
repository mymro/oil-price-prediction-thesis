Feb 7 (Reuters) - U.S. refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp would replace crude oil from Venezuela with imports from the Middle East and Latin America, a top company executive said. “We see those replacement barrels being...Arabian Gulf barrels, as well as predominantly, Latin American barrels,” Rick Hessling, a senior vice president at Marathon’s MLP unit, said on a post-earnings conference call. The U.S. imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA last week to curb OPEC members’ crude exports to the United States and pressure Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down.
