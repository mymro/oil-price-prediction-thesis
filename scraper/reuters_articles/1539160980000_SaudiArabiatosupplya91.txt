NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, the worldâ€™s biggest oil exporter, will supply Indian oil buyers with an additional 4 million barrels of crude oil in November, several sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Reliance Industries Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp , Bharat Petroleum Corp and Mangalore Refinery Petrochemicals Ltd, sought an additional 1 million barrels each in November, one of the sources said. Reuters last week reported that Russia and Saudi Arabia struck a private deal in September to raise output to cool rising prices and had informed the United States about the decision.
