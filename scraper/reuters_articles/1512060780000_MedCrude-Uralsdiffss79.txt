MOSCOW, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Urals crude differentials in northwest Europe were seen slightly higher in a spot tender on Thursday, while Caspian CPC Blend differentials flipped to a premium over dated Brent. OPEC agreed on Thursday to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 as it tries to finish clearing a global glut of crude, while signalling it could exit the deal earlier if the market overheats. Non-OPEC Russia, which this year reduced production significantly with OPEC for the first time, has been pushing for a clear message on how to exit the cuts so the market does not flip into a deficit too soon, prices do not rally too fast and rival U.S. shale firms do not boost output further. There were no bids or offers for Urals and Azeri BTC in the Platts window in Thursday, traders said.
