MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that it was too early to draw any conclusions on attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman because of the lack of information. “No one knows what is behind it,” he said. Two oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday, leaving one ablaze and both adrift, shipping firms said, driving oil prices as much as 4% higher over worries about Middle East supplies.
