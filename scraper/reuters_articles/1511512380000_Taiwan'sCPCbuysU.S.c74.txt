SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Taiwanese refiner CPC Corp [MOEATA.UL] has bought 4 million barrels of U.S. crude via tender for January-February delivery, skipping African oil, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Friday. Occidental and Unipec sold 2 million barrels each of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Midland crude to CPC, they said. This would be CPCâ€™s second purchase of U.S. crude in two months and replaces Angolan crude which the refiner typically buys. The supplies are part of a large influx of U.S. crude heading to Asia after WTI prices fell to their lowest level against Brent in years.
