(Reuters) - Russian energy minister Alexander Novak declined to comment on Thursday when asked whether Russia supports the current OPEC+ deal or would be in favor of additional cuts at an OPEC+ meeting in Vienna. Speaking in the Austrian capital, Novak said Russiaâ€™s stance would become clear later in the day. Earlier on Thursday, Reuters reported that OPEC+ will discuss deeper oil cuts of more than 400,000 bpd as a main scenario, according to two sources.
