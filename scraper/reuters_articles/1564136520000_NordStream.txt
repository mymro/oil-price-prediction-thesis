MOSCOW, July 26 (Reuters) - Nord Stream 2 AG has asked Europe’s highest court to annul European Union measures it described as “discriminatory” against its gas pipeline project, the company said on Friday. Nord Stream 2 said it had asked the Court of Justice of the European Union to annul an amendment to an EU gas directive “because of an infringement of the EU law principles of equal treatment and proportionality.” The Nord Stream 2 project is led by Russian state energy firm Gazprom, with some 50% of the funding provided by Germany’s Uniper and BASF’s Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch firm Shell, Austria’s OMV and France’s Engie.
