JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia, April 20 (Reuters) - UAE Energy Minister Suhail Mohamed al-Mazrouei said on Friday oil prices were not artificially high and OPEC and non-OPEC countries were playing their role to correct the market. Mazrouei made his remarks after being asked to comment on U.S. President Donald Trump’s tweet earlier on Friday in which he said oil prices were artificially very high. “I am not going to comment on what the president said, but definitely we are doing our role to correct the market and the market as we said is not yet balanced and I think this group has a job to do and we are continuing to do our job,” Mazrouei said.
