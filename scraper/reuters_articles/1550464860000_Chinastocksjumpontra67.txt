Chinese state media on the weekend said that the trade negotiations, which continue in Washington this week, were “making a final sprint” ahead of a March 1 deadline for a deal. ** A trade detente between the U.S. and China could help a post-Lunar New Year market bounce turn into a broader market recovery phase, analysts at Huatai Securities said in a note. They also listed improving liquidity, possible policy introductions at the upcoming annual meeting of China’s parliament and expanded MSCI index inclusion of Chinese A-shares as possibly market-boosting factors. ** China’s banks made the most new loans on record in January as policymakers try to jumpstart sluggish investment and prevent a sharper slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. ** “Usually financial data leads economic data, so it can be hoped that financial data will also show stabilization. Once economic fundamentals improve at the margins, the market’s risk appetite may also gradually recover, and banks may be more willing to issue loans, which could in turn stimulate the economy in a virtuous cycle,” analysts at Huachuang Securities said in a note. ** “Of course, this process of improvement needs time, and in the short term, the market’s pessimistic expectations for the economy will not be turned around completely, but at least at present the economy is certainly not continuing to slide,” the analysts said. ** Rising oil prices supported Chinese energy firms, with the Hang Seng energy index rising 2.83 percent and the CSI energy index up 1.63 percent.
