Oct 4 (Reuters) - Futures pointed to a lower opening for Canada’s main stock index on Thursday as oil prices fell on the possibility of higher output from Saudi Arabia and Russia offsetting tighter supplies following the sanctions on Iran, as well as a jump in global bond yields. The two countries struck a private deal in September to raise oil production to cool rising prices, sources told Reuters. Global stock markets were pressured after strong U.S. services sector and payrolls data powered a jump in Treasury yields and also strengthened chances of a Federal Reserve rate hike.

Small Canadian oil producers are striking complex deals with refineries, diversifying production and seeking marketing help as they try to soften the blow from record price discounts on heavy crude generated by pipeline congestion. Major oil producers must take “the right steps” to ease supply concerns that have lifted crude prices to a four-year high, the head of the International Energy Agency told Reuters.
