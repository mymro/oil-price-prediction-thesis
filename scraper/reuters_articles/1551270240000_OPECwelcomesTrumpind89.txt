RIYADH (Reuters) - OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump was welcome to join a dialogue on balancing supply and demand in the global oil market. The United States, as the world’s biggest oil producer, has a strategic stake in supply and demand globally, Barkindo said when asked about Trump’s Monday tweet telling OPEC that oil prices were becoming too high and to “relax and take it easy”. Barkindo was speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of an oil conference in Riyadh.
