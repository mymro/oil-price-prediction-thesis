MOSCOW (Reuters) - Lukoil CEO Vagit Alekperov said he is against any changes to a global deal on curbing oil supplies agreed between OPEC and its allies, Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency reported on Wednesday.     Sources earlier told Reuters that OPEC and other oil-producing nations would consider whether to deepen cuts when they meet in December due to worries about weak demand growth in 2020.  “I am a supporter of keeping everything stable until April, when the agreement expires, and only after that... to make decisions,” RIA cited Alekperov as saying.
