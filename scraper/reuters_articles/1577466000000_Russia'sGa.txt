MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Gazprom said on Friday it had paid Ukraine $2.9 billion to settle a legal row, part of a wider gas package deal reached last week. Last week, Russia and Ukraine announced the terms of a new gas transit deal under which Moscow will supply Europe for at least five years via its former Soviet neighbor and pay a $2.9 billion settlement to Kiev to end a legal dispute. In exchange, Kiev is set to drop another legal claim. Russia and Ukraine plan to sign the final deal before the end of this year. A spokesman for Ukraine’s energy company Naftogaz confirmed it had received the $2.9 billion from Gazprom.
