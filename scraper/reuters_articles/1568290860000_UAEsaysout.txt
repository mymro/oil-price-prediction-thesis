ABU DHABI (Reuters) - More oil will be removed from global markets if producers comply fully with agreed supply curbs, the United Arab Emirates energy minister said on Thursday. “Additional volumes will be removed as a result of full conformity,” Minister of Energy and Industry Suhail al-Mazrouei told reporters after a meeting of some OPEC+ ministers in Abu Dhabi, which comes ahead of a formal gathering in December.
