SYDNEY, June 6 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures rose nearly 1% on Thursday to rebound from a near one-week low, though gains were checked amid easing concerns about the state of the North American crops. * The most active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade was up 0.8% at $4.94-3/4 a bushel by 0105 GMT after closing down 3.3% on Wednesday when prices hit a low of $4.88-1/2 a bushel — the lowest since May 30. * The most active corn futures were down 0.2% at $4.14 a bushel after closing down 2.5% on Wednesday. * The most active soybean futures were down 0.3% at $8.67 a bushel, having closed down 1.4% on Wednesday. * Wheat had been supported by worries about crop damage after the recent heavy rains, but a recent U.S. Department of Agriculture report said U.S. winter wheat looked good and rain was forecast for the Black Sea region, which has faced hot and dry weather. * Reuters reported on Tuesday that Archer Daniels Midland Co and other grain traders were selling Brazilian corn to Smithfield Foods Inc in the United States, where wet weather has reduced plantings. * Corn was under pressure amid fears of a trade war between the United States and China. Mexico is a major importer of U.S. corn. * The U.S. dollar was higher on Wednesday afternoon, retracing its earlier fall to a six-month low against the Japanese yen following weak private sector jobs data in the United States. * Oil prices fell on Wednesday, with West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) dropping to its lowest since January after U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly surged, adding to concerns about slowing global growth. * Wall Street’s major indexes rose on Wednesday as investors bet on a Federal Reserve interest rate cut after weak private sector jobs data and hopes grew that the United States and Mexico would reach an agreement to avoid U.S. tariffs on Mexican goods. 0130   Australia   Trade Balance G&S (A$)   April 0600   Germany     Industrial Orders MM     April 0615   India       Cash Reserve Ratio 0615   India       Repo Rate 0615   India       Reverse Repo Rate 0900   Euro Zone   GDP Revised QQ           Q1 0900   Euro Zone   GDP Revised YY           Q1 1145   Euro Zone   ECB Refinancing Rate     June 1145   Euro Zone   ECB Deposit Rate         June 1145   Euro Zone   The ECB announces its policy decision 1200   France      Reserve Assets Total     May 1230   Euro Zone   ECB President Mario Draghi to hold a press conference 1230   US          International Trade $    April 1230   US          Initial Jobless Claim    weekly 1230   Canada      Trade Balance C$         April 1300   Russia      CPI MM                   May 1300   Russia      CPI YY                   May
