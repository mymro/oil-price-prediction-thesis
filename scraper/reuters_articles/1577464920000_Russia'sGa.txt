MOSCOW, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Russiaâ€™s Gazprom said on Friday it has paid Ukraine $2.9 billion to settle a legal row, part of a wider gas package deal reached last week. Last week, Russia and Ukraine announced the terms of a new gas transit deal, under which Moscow will supply Europe for at least another five years via its former Soviet neighbour and pay a $2.9 billion settlement to Kiev to end a legal dispute. In exchange, Kiev is set to drop another legal claim. Russia and Ukraine plan to sign the final deal before the end of this year.
