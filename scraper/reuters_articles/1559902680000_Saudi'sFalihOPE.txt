St Petersburg (Reuters) - Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Friday that an extension of a 1.2 million barrel per day oil output cut beyond this month was all but agreed among OPEC members but still needed discussions with non-OPEC allies in the deal. “On the OPEC side a rollover is almost in the bag... The question is to calibrate with non-OPEC,” Falih said at an economic conference in St Petersburg, Russia. “I don’t think there will be a need to deepen the cut.”
