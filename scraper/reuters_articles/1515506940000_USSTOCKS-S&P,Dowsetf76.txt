A handful of retailers such as Target, Kohl’s Corp and Lululemon Athletica have already reported solid rise in same-store sales for the holiday period and raised their profit forecasts for the fourth quarter. U.S. stocks also found support from gains across global stock markets in the day, buoyed by upbeat industrial production data from Germany and jump in oil prices. Oil rose above $68 a barrel, touching its highest since May 2015, supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations of lower U.S. crude inventories. “we are looking at a quiet day, with no major news. But investors are starting to prepare for the next round of earnings that could keep the market on fire,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “People are going to look for what is going to create opportunity for more money to flow into equity.” At 8:29 a.m. ET (1329 GMT), Dow e-minis were up 60 points, or 0.24 percent, with 19,077 contracts changing hands.

The winning streak of U.S. stocks had dimmed a bit on Monday but gains in technology, utilities and real estate stocks helped the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq end higher. Investors are waiting for the start of the quarterly earnings season for more readings on the impact of recent tax cuts and profit forecasts for the rest of the year. Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 11.8 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an 8 percent increase a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
