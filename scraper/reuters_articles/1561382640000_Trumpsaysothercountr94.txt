WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that other countries, including China and Japan, should protect their own oil tankers in the Middle East. “So why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries (many years) for zero compensation,” Trump said on Twitter. “All of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been a dangerous journey.” (Reporting by Makini Brice)
