SALEKHARD, Russia, April 16 (Reuters) - Gazprom Neft , the oil arm of Russian gas giant Gazprom, expects the global oil deal between OPEC and its allies to end in the first half of the year, a company official said on Tuesday. Vadim Yakovlev, first deputy CEO of Gazprom Neft, said the global oil alliance should still remain in place, at least in the form of coordination between the worldâ€™s top global oil producers. Gazprom Neft is currently taking long-term investment decisions assuming an oil price of $50 per barrel, Yakovlev said. (Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin Editing by Tom Balmforth)
