MOSCOW, April 6 (Reuters) - The CEO of Russia’s Gazprom , Alexei Miller, said on Friday he was proud of having been included on a new U.S. sanctions list and that the company’s policies were right. “Not being included in the first list I even had some doubts - may be something is wrong (with me)? But I am finally included. This means that we are doing everything right,” Miller said through his spokesman. The United States imposed sanctions against Russian businessmen, companies and government officials, striking at associates of President Vladimir Putin in one of Washington’s most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for a range of activities, including alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
