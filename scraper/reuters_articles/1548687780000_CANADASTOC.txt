Jan 28 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index fell on Monday as shares of energy companies were pressured by a decline in oil prices after U.S. companies added rigs, a signal that crude output may rise further. * The energy sector shed 1.7 percent, the most among the 6 major sectors in the red, as U.S. crude prices fell 2.9 percent per barrel, while Brent crude lost 2.3 percent. * SNC-Lavalin Group plunged 19.7 percent, the most on the main index and pushed industrials 1.5 percent lower. * The construction and engineering firm cut its forecast for full-year 2018 profit, citing a problem with a project in its mining and metallurgy unit, as well as ongoing trading challenges in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia. * At 9:43 a.m. ET (14:43 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was down 81.86 points, or 0.53 percent, at 15,284.19. * The Canadian dollar weakened against its U.S. counterpart, pulling back from its highest in more than two weeks as oil prices fell and investors grew more concerned over China’s economy. * Global stocks were pressured by a second straight monthly fall in profits for China’s industrial firms. * On the TSX, 79 issues were higher, while 155 issues declined for a 1.96-to-1 ratio to the downside, with traded volume touching 16.91 million shares. * The largest percentage gainers on the TSX were Iamgold Corp and Alamos Gold Inc. * The most heavily traded shares by volume were Critical Control Energy Services Corp, Aurora Cannabis, and Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd. * The TSX posted four new 52-week highs and one new low. * Across all Canadian issues, there were 10 new 52-week highs and three new lows, with total volume of 35.15 million shares.
