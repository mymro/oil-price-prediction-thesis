NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks across the globe rose for a seventh straight session on Tuesday despite late selling on Wall Street, while the pound wobbled against the dollar as traders expected European Union officials would allow Britain a delay on Brexit. Bets that the Federal Reserve will this week reinforce the market view that the U.S. monetary policy tightening cycle is in the rear-view mirror have kept alive the bid on stocks, while the dollar index touched its lowest since March 1. But trade news weighed on sentiment late in the New York trading session after Bloomberg News reported that some negotiators are worried that China is pushing back against U.S. demands. “Trade fear has reared its head again with Trump administration concerns (that) China is walking back some of the pledges they’ve made in negotiations so far,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Alliance in Charlotte. Investor focus will remain on the Fed on Wednesday, particularly on whether policymakers have sufficiently lowered their interest rate forecasts to align more closely their “dot plot,” which shows individual policymakers’ rate views for the next three years, with market expectations. The CitiFX U.S. economic surprise index, which measures economic data against expectations, has been negative for over a month and earlier in March touched its lowest since August 2017.

The dollar index fell 0.12 percent, with the euro up 0.11 percent to $1.1349. “What we are seeing is the market positioning for potentially a more dovish tone tomorrow,” said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at California’s Silicon Valley Bank, speaking about expectations of what the Fed’s statement will be like on Wednesday. The Japanese yen was flat versus the greenback at 111.43 per dollar. Among commodities, oil prices were little changed after hitting 2019 highs, maintaining recent strength on the back of expectations for producer club OPEC to continue production cuts. U.S. sanctions against producers Iran and Venezuela have also supported prices, although traders said the market may be capped by rising U.S. output.
