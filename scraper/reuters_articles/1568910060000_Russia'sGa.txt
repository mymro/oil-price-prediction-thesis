BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Russia’s Gazprom is willing to accept a short-term extension of its gas transit contract with Ukraine, Chief Executive Alexey Miller said on Thursday after talks with Ukraine and the European Union. “There is a risk that Ukraine will not be able to... create an independent certified gas transit operator, an independent regulator, before Jan. 1, 2020,” Miller told the Rossiya-24 TV channel. “Today we discussed that... it would make sense to consider a plan B: an extension of the current contract for some short period of time,” Miller said.
