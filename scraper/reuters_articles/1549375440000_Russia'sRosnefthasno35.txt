MOSCOW, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Russian oil producer Rosneft has no plans to “choke” output at its Russkoye field because of the global output deal between OPEC and non OPEC countries, a Rosneft official said on a conference call on Tuesday. Rosneft expects there to be delays to several of its new project developments in the first half of 2019, the official said.
