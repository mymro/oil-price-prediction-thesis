WARSAW, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Poland’s dominant gas firm, state-run PGNiG, said on Friday it had notified Russia’s Gazprom that it did  not intend to extend their long-term deal on gas supplies when it expires after 2022. Poland has said before that it does not plan to buy gas from Gazprom after 2022, but the agreement signed in 1996, known as the Yamal contract, required that the parties formally submit declarations regarding future cooperation three years before the deal expires. Poland still buys most of the gas it consumes from Gazprom, but has taken steps to reduce its reliance on the Russian firm, as it considers the conditions of the Yamal deal unfavourable. PGNiG said in a statement its contracted liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies and acquisitions of gas deposits in the North Sea would guarantee security of supplies after 2022. Gazprom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reporting by Agnieszka Barteczko; Additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Mark Potter)
