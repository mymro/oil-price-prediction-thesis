April 19 (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a higher opening for Canada’s main stock index on Thursday, tracking a fierce rally in commodities and resource stocks following talk that Saudi Arabia has its sights on $80-$100 a barrel oil again. June futures on the S&P TSX index were up 0.21 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET. Oil prices rose to their highest since late 2014 as U.S. crude inventories declined, moving closer to five-year averages. Canada’s main stock index rose for the fifth straight day on Wednesday to reach a four-week high, as energy and metal mining companies led broad-based gains, boosted by higher commodity prices. Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures were down 0.05 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET, while S&P 500 e-mini futures fell 0.09 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures were 0.12 percent lower. (Morning News Call newsletter link.reuters.com/nex49s; The Day Ahead newsletter link.reuters.com/mex49s) Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd reported on Wednesday an 5.1 percent drop in first-quarter profit hurt by a fall in volumes of crude oil and refined products transports. Canadian Pacific Railway’s first-quarter profit topped analysts’ expectations as the railroad operator shipped higher volumes of commodities such as potash and crude oil, offseting the impact of higher expenses. GrafTech International Ltd raised $525 million in its U.S. initial public offering on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter said, netting owner Brookfield Asset Management Inc a smaller-than-expected windfall.
