NEW YORK (Reuters) - TC Energy Corp told a majority of Keystone oil pipeline shippers that November volumes would be cut by nearly 39% after a leak in North Dakota spilled more than 9,000 barrels about two weeks ago, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. TC Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had earlier told shippers that the outage meant it could not carry out 30% of their normal November shipments on the 590,000 barrel-per-day line from Alberta to U.S. Midwest refineries. TC Energy has completed repairs and restarted the pipeline at a 20% pressure reduction, a U.S. regulator said on Tuesday. The line was shut in late October after a drop in pressure was detected. News of the outage initially sent the discount on Canadian heavy crude versus U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude to an 11-month high of about $22 a barrel. Western Canada Select (WCS) heavy blend crude for December delivery in Hardisty, Alberta, was trading at $19 per barrel below WTI on Tuesday, according to Net Energy Exchange, narrower than Fridayâ€™s settle of $21.40 below. The market was closed on Monday for a holiday. WCS was seen at about $18.25 a barrel below WTI futures early on Wednesday, traders said.
