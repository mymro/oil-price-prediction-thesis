MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom has filed an appeal against a ruling by the Stockholm arbitration court on gas deliveries to Ukraine, Gazprom Deputy CEO Alexander Medvedev said in a statement on Tuesday. The court has ordered Gazprom to pay more than $2.5 billion to Ukrainian energy firm Naftogaz - a ruling meant to conclude a long legal battle that has run alongside Ukraineâ€™s broader political stand-off with Russia. Medvedev also said Gazprom would file another appeal before the end of march concerning the transit issue.
