TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese government energy panel called on Wednesday for the national reserve scheme for oil and rare metals to be strengthened to ensure the country can secure key fuels and materials. Resource-poor Japan faces an increasing risk of supply disruptions as it buys 90% of its oil from the Middle East where geopolitical tensions are on rising. It is also competing with other countries to secure liquefied natural gas (LNG) and critical metals used in batteries and other high-tech products as global demand for these resources is growing rapidly. The panel’s recommendations will feed into a new resource strategy to be mapped out by Japan’s industry ministry next year. It recommended reinforcing the national reserve scheme for 34 kinds of rare metals to better meet the latest industrial demand as China is becoming a more dominant producer for many metals. That poses risks as China can suddenly reduce or ban exports as it did in 2010-2011. The panel did not give details of how the scheme could be reinforced. Other recommendations include better coordination between Japanese ministries to help improve national energy and resource security, and widening and strengthening the functions of state-run Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp (JOGMEC), such as allowing them to raise funds for new development projects. The panel also urged the government to bring its resource policy in line with the nation’s efforts to cut CO2 emissions amid growing pressure to move away from fossil fuels and turn to cleaner energy. The industry ministry plans to draw up the new resource strategy next year, which will replace the previous one set out in 2012, but the timing and details have yet to be decided, an official at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said.
