Oct 22 (Reuters) - Futures for Canada’s main stock index edged up on Monday, supported by gains in energy stocks. Energy stocks were helped by a rise in oil prices, which edged up above $80 a barrel, lifted by nervousness over a worsening diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and the West, just two weeks before U.S. sanctions potentially choke off Iranian crude supplies. Saudi Arabia has no intention of unleashing a 1973-style oil embargo on Western consumers and will isolate oil from politics, the Saudi energy minister said on Monday, amid a worsening crisis over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
