Nov 17 (Reuters) - Futures pointed to a slightly higher opening for Canada’s main stock index on Friday amid a rise in oil prices and ahead of monthly inflation data. The annual inflation rate is expected to have cooled to 1.4 percent in October, which will likely give the Bank of Canada room to take its time raising interest rates after two back-to-back hikes earlier this year. The data is due for release at 0830 ET. Oil prices rose but remained en route for their first week of losses in six, as concerns grew over Russia’s support for an extension of the crude output cuts that have bolstered prices in recent months. December futures on the S&P TSX index were up 0.08 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET. Canada’s main stock index broke a six-day losing streak on Thursday, helped by gains among its biggest banking stocks as bond yields rose, while continued weakness in oil prices weighed on its energy companies. Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures were down 0.06 percent at 7:15 a.m. ET, while S&P 500 e-mini futures were down 0.05 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures were up 0.11 percent.
